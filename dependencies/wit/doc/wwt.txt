*******************************************************************************

Wiimms ISO Toolset (WIT) is a command line tool set for linux and for other
unix like operating systems including cygwin. The tools manage WBFS partitions
and ISO Images. WWT cotains the following tools:

The both main tools are:
  wit      : Wiimms ISO Tool manage ISO files.
  wwt      : Wiimms WBFS Tool manage WBFS partitions.

And these are special WDF and CISO tools:
  wdf-cat  : a 'cat' like programm with special handling of WDF files.
  wdf-dump : dump the data structure of a WDF file.

The software is developed under the GPL 2.0 license. See file gpl-2.0.txt

wwt: Wiimms WBFS Tool v3.05a r8638 cygwin64 - Dirk Clemens - 2022-08-27

wwt : Wiimms WBFS Tool (WBFS manager) : It can create, check, repair, verify
      and clone WBFS files and partitions. It can list, add, extract, remove,
      rename and recover ISO images as part of a WBFS.

Syntax: wwt [option]... command [option|parameter|file]...


Commands:

  VERSION           : Print program name and version and exit.
  HELP      | H     : Print help and exit. If the first non option is a valid
                      command name, then a help for the given command is
                      printed.
  ARGTEST           : This debug command accepts all kinds of parameters and
                      prints one line for each parameter.
  INFO              : Print some internal information about the keywords. If
                      the keyword ALL is set or no keyword is entered, then all
                      informations are printed. Possible keywords are:

                      is entered, print a table with all error messages.
  COMPR             : Scan compression modes and print the normalized names.
                      See option --compression for syntax details. If no mode
                      is given than print a table with all available
                      compression modes and alternative mode names.
  FEATURES          : Check, if the requested features are available. All
                      keywords are possible. If no keyword is used, all
                      supported features are printed. The exit status is 0 for
                      'all features supported', 1 for 'some features supported'
                      and 2 for 'no feature supported'.

  DUMP      | D     : Dump the data structure of WBFS partitions.

  ID6       | ID    : List all ID6 of all discs of WBFS partitions. If the ID
                      list is set use it as selector.
  LIST      | LS    : List all discs of WBFS partitions.
  LIST-L    | LL    : List all discs of WBFS partitions with size and region.
                      'LIST-L' is a shortcut for 'LIST --long'.
  LIST-LL   | LLL   : List all discs of WBFS partitions with date, size and
                      region. 'LIST-LL' is a shortcut for 'LIST --long --long'.
  LIST-LLL  | LLLL  : List all discs of WBFS partitions with date, time, size
                      and region. 'LIST-LLL' is a shortcut for 'LIST --long
                      --long --long'.
  LIST-A    | LA    : List all discs of all WBFS partitions. 'LIST-A' is a
                      shortcut for 'LIST --long --long --auto'.
  LIST-M    | LM    : List all discs of WBFS partitions in mixed view. 'LIST-M'
                      is a shortcut for 'LIST --long --long --mixed'.
  LIST-U    | LU    : List all discs of WBFS partitions in mixed view. 'LIST-U'
                      is a shortcut for 'LIST --long --long --unique'.
  LIST-F    | LF    : List all discs of WBFS partitions and include
                      fragmentation info. 'LIST-F' is a shortcut for 'LIST
                      --fragments'.

  FORMAT    | INIT  : Initialize (=format) WBFS partitions and files. Combine
                      with --recover to recover discs.
  RECOVER           : Recover deleted discs of WBFS partitions.
  CHECK     | FSCK  : Check WBFS partitions and print error listing. To repair
                      WBFS partitions use the option '--repair modelist'.
  REPAIR            : Check WBFS partitions and repair errors. 'REPAIR' is a
                      shortcut for 'CHECK --repair standard'.
  EDIT              : Low level edit of slot and block assignments. Dangerous!
                      Read the documentation!
  PHANTOM           : Add NUM phantom discs with entered SIZE (default unit
                      'g') with a generic ID6 ('PHT###' where '###' is the
                      smallest not already used integer). If NUM and/or SIZE
                      are ranges use random values from this range.
                        Phantom discs have no content and only a header is
                      written. This makes adding discs very fast and this is
                      good for testing. The creation process stops if the WBFS
                      becomes full. In this case, the last added image may be
                      shorter as planned.
  TRUNCATE  | TR    : Truncate WBFS partitions to the really used size.

  ADD       | A     : Add Wii and GameCube ISO discs to WBFS partitions.
                      Images, WBFS partitions and directories are accepted as
                      source.
  UPDATE    | U     : Add missing Wii and GameCube ISO discs to WBFS
                      partitions. Images, WBFS partitions and directories are
                      accepted as source. 'UPDATE' is a shortcut for 'ADD
                      --update'.
  NEW       | N     : Add missing and newer Wii and GameCube ISO discs to WBFS
                      partitions. Images, WBFS partitions and directories are
                      accepted as source. 'NEW' is a shortcut for 'ADD --update
                      --newer'.
  SYNC              : Modify primary WBFS (REMOVE and ADD) until it contains
                      exactly the same discs as all sources together. Images,
                      WBFS partitions and directories are accepted as source.
                      'SYNC' is a shortcut for 'ADD --sync'.
  DUP               : Duplicate source WBFS files or partitions and create new
                      WBFS files. If multiple sources entered, the destination
                      must be a directory. All used WBFS blocks are copied 1:1
                      to the destination file and unused blocks are skipped and
                      stored as sparse blocks.
  EXTRACT   | X     : Extract discs from WBFS partitions and store them as Wii
                      or GameCube images.
  SCRUB             : Scrub discs of WBFS partitions and rewrite (repair) the
                      WBFS block map. Use '+' as ID6 to scrub all images of the
                      WBFS partitions. Use option --psel=list to remove image
                      partitions.
  REMOVE    | RM    : Remove discs from WBFS partitions.
  RENAME    | REN   : Rename the ID6 and/or the disc title of WBFS discs.
  SETTITLE  | ST    : Set the disc title of WBFS discs.

  VERIFY    | V     : Verify all discs of WBFS (calculate and compare SHA1
                      checksums) to find bad dumps.
  SKELETON  | SKEL  : Create very small skeletons of ISO images. A skeleton
                      contains only disc and partition headers for further
                      analysis and is not playable because all files are
                      zeroed. Read https://wit.wiimm.de/cmd/wwt/skel for more
                      details.

  FILETYPE  | FTYPE : Print a status line for each source file.

Type 'wwt HELP command' to get command specific help.

Global options:

  -V --version       Stop parsing the command line, print a version info and
                     exit.
  -h --help          Stop parsing the command line, print a help message and
                     exit.
     --xhelp         Stop parsing the command line and print a help message
                     with all commands included. Exit after printing.
     --config file   Define a configuration file or a directory as source. In
                     later case, file 'wiimms-iso-tools.conf' is searched.
                       If option is not not set, then file
                     'wiimms-iso-tools.conf' is searched in different
                     directories. Use command 'wszst CONFIG' to get more
                     details.
     --width width   Define the width (number of columns) for help and some
                     other messages and disable the automatic detection of the
                     terminal width.
  -q --quiet         Be quiet and print only error messages.
  -v --verbose       Be verbose and print more progress information. Multiple
                     usage is possible: Progress counter is enabled if set at
                     least two times. Extended logging is enabled if set at
                     least four times. The impact of the other verbose levels
                     are command dependent.
  -P --progress      Print progress counter. If --verbose is set at least
                     twice, printing is enabled too. If progress is enabled,
                     the default of --dsync is changed.
     --scan-progress Print a message for each found image while scanning the
                     file system.
  -L --logging       This debug option enables the logging of internal memory
                     maps. If set twice second level memory maps are printed
                     too.
  -E --esc char      Define an alternative escape character for destination
                     files. The default is '%'. For Windows (CYGWIN) it is a
                     good choice to set '-E$' to avoid conflicts with command
                     shell variables.
     --color=[=modus] 
                     Define the modus for colored text output. Allowed keywords
                     are: OFF or NO-COLORS to disable colors, AUTO (default)
                     for automatic detection, ON for automatic detection but
                     never OFF, 8-COLORS and 256-COLORS for 8 and 256 color
                     support. Without parameter, ON is used.
                       AUTO will enable colorized output only for terminals.
                     AUTO and ON use environment variable TERM to find the
                     correct color modus.
                       If a command is prefixed by 'C-', then --color=ON is
                     used implicitly as default.
     --256-colors    Short cut for --color=256-colors: Force colorized text
                     with 256 color support.
     --no-colors     Short cut for --color=off: Deactivate colorized text. This
                     is the default, if an output file is not a terminal.
     --io flags      Setup the IO mode for experiments. The standard file IO is
                     based on open() function. The value '1' defines that WBFS
                     IO is based on fopen() function. The value '2' defines the
                     same for ISO files and value '4' for WIA files. You can
                     combine the values by adding them.
     --dsync=[=mode] This option enables the usage of flag O_DSYNC when opening
                     a partition at a hard drive for writing. With activated
                     flag, writing an image is some percent slower, but the
                     progress counters are exact again.
                       Parameter MODE is optional. If set, it is one of OFF
                     (disable), ON (enable) or AUTO (default). With AUTO, DSYNC
                     is enabled if the progress counters are active.
                       This option has only impact, if compiler and operation
                     system support the flag O_DSYNC. Linux does.

  -T --titles file   Read file for disc titles. -T/ disables automatic search
                     for title files.
     --utf-8         Enables UTF-8 support for filenames (default).
     --no-utf-8      Disables UTF-8 support for filenames.
     --lang lang     Define the language for titles.

  -t --test          Run in test mode, modify nothing.
                     >>> USE THIS OPTION IF UNSURE! <<<

     --sh            Dump info using SH syntax. Use '--var name' as prefix.
     --bash          Dump info using BASH syntax. Use '--var name' as prefix.
     --json          Dump info using JSON syntax. Options --var and --array are
                     ignored.
     --php           Dump infos using PHP syntax. Use '--var name' as variable
                     name of the resulting object.
     --makedoc       Dump infos using MakeDoc syntax. Use '--var name' as
                     variable name of the resulting map.
     --var varname   Use VARNAME as variable name or prefix on script output.
                     The default variabe name is 'res'.
     --array         Use an array on script output if possible. If arrays are
                     not supported, then append a '_#' suffix with an zero
                     based index to the variable name defined by '--var name'.
                     In this case, only one output file is created.
     --avar varname  Shortcut for: '--array --var name'
     --case case     CASE is one of LOWER, AUTO (default) or UPPER.If LOWER or
                     UPPER are set, then the lower/upper case of the variable
                     names is adjusted accordingly.
     --install param Manage configuration for an installation.

  -f --force         Force operation.

     --align-wdf [align][,minhole] 
                     Parameter align defines the aligning factor for new WDF
                     images. It must be a power of 2 and smaller or equal than
                     1 GiB. The default WDF alignment is 1 for WDF v1 and 4 for
                     WDF v2. Usual values are 1, 512, 4K and 32K.
                       The optional parameter minhole defines the minimal hole
                     size, before a new chunk is created. If NULL, an internal
                     value is used to minimize the total file size. minhole
                     can't be smaller than align.
     --gcz-block size 
                     The value defines the block size, if creating a GCZ image.
                     The default is 16K (also Dolphins default). Smaller values
                     enlarge the managment data and reduce the compression
                     ratio. Use the option with caution!
     --allow-fst=[=mode] 
                     Enable the usage of extracted images.MODE is either OFF,
                     AUTO (default) or ON. Without value, ON is used. If mode
                     is AUTO, extracted images are usually enabled.
     --allow-nkit=[=mode] 
                     Enable the detection of NKIT images.MODE is either OFF,
                     AUTO (default) or ON. Without value, ON is used. If mode
                     is AUTO, the NKIT detection is enabled only for a few
                     analytic commands.
                       Anyway, NKIT images are not supported yet, but detected
                     to print warnings.

  -a --auto          Search for WBFS partitions using '/proc/partitions' or
                     searching hard disks in '/dev/'.
  -A --all           Use all WBFS partitions found.
  -p --part part     Define a primary WBFS file or partition. Multiple usage
                     possible.
     --no-check      Disable automatic check of WBFS before modifications.

     --wbfs-alloc mode 
                     Select one WBFS block allocation modus:
                       FIRST: Use always the first free WBFS block. NO-FRAG:
                     Find large blocks to minimize fragmentation. AUTO
                     (=default): Use modus NO-FRAG for partitions >=20GiB and
                     modus FIRST for partitions <20GiB and for files.
     --source path   Use the entered file or directory as source.
                       If parameter PATH contains at least one wildcard (e.g.
                     '*.wbfs'), then PATH is used as search pattern and all
                     found files are added. In order to use this variant, the
                     calling shell must not interpret the wildcards. Therefore,
                     the parameter must usually be enclosed in single or double
                     quotes.
                       Directories are expanded to all containing files but
                     hidden files (file names begins with a point) are ignored.
                     If a command needs only images then non image files of the
                     directory are ignored without notification. The option
                     --no-expand suppress the directory expansion.
     --no-expand     Do not expand directories to the containing files or
                     images. This option does not change the behavior of
                     --recurse.
  -r --recurse path  If path is not a directory, then it is used as a simple
                     source file like --source.
                       If parameter PATH contains at least one wildcard (e.g.
                     '*.wbfs'), then PATH is used as search pattern and all
                     found files are added. In order to use this variant, the
                     calling shell must not interpret the wildcards. Therefore,
                     the parameter must usually be enclosed in single or double
                     quotes.
                       Directories are scanned for source files recursively.
                     The option --rdepth limits the search depth. Hidden files
                     and hidden sub directories (file names begins with a
                     point) and files with non supported file types (non ISO
                     files for most commands) are ignored without notification.
     --rdepth depth  Set the maximum recurse depth for option --recurse. The
                     default search depth is 10.
  -x --exclude id    A comma separated list with ID4 and ID6 values is
                     expected. '.' is a wildcard for exact 1 character and '+'
                     is a wildcard for any number characters. If the parameter
                     begins with a '@' the given file is read and each line is
                     scanned for one ID. Images with the given ID are excluded
                     from operation. Each use of this option expands the
                     exclude list. See --include-first for precedence issues.
  -X --exclude-path file_or_dir 
                     Scan the ID of the source and add it to the exclude list.
                     If the source is a directory then scan all images of the
                     directory. Images with the given ID are excluded from
                     operation. Each use of this option expands the exclude
                     list. See --include-first for precedence issues.
  -n --include id    A comma separated list with ID values is expected. '.' is
                     a wildcard for exact 1 character and '+' is a wildcard for
                     any number characters. If the parameter begins with a '@'
                     the given file is read and each line is scanned for one
                     ID. Only images with the given ID are included into the
                     operation. Each use of this option expands the include
                     list. See --include-first for precedence issues.
  -N --include-path file_or_dir 
                     Scan the ID of the source and add it to the include list.
                     If the source is a directory then scan all images of the
                     directory. Only images with the given ID are included into
                     the operation. Each use of this option expands the include
                     list. See --include-first for precedence issues.
     --include-first The options --include, --include-path, --exclude and
                     --exclude-path decide which discs are included into the
                     operation. If neither include nor exclude options are
                     used, than all disc are included into the operation. If
                     only include options are used, than only the specified
                     discs are operated. If only exclude options are used, than
                     all all discs but not the excluded are operated.
                       If include and exclude options are used together and
                     --include-first is not set, than all discs are operated
                     that are specified by any include option and not by any
                     exclude option. If --include-first is set, than all discs
                     are ignored that are specified by any exclude option and
                     not by any include option.
  -1 --one-job       Execute only the first job and exit. This is a shortcut
                     for '--job-limit 1'.
     --job-limit num Execute only the first 'num' jobs and exit. If done
                     without errors the exit status is OK (zero).
  -i --ignore        Ignore non existing files/discs without warning. If set
                     twice then all non Wii and GameCube ISO images are ignored
                     too.
     --ignore-fst    Disable composing and ignore FST directories as input.
                     This legacy option is a shortcut for --allow-fst=off.
     --ignore-setup  While composing ignore the file 'setup.txt', which defines
                     some partition parameters.
     --links         Detect soft and hard linked source files while composing
                     or extracting discs and try to create hard links instead
                     of independent copies on the destination file system.

  -q --quiet         Be quiet and print only error messages.
  -v --verbose       Show a runtime summary for each job. If set twice enable
                     progress information. If set three times the progress
                     information is more detailed.
  -P --progress      Print progress counter. If --verbose is set at least
                     twice, printing is enabled too. If progress is enabled,
                     the default of --dsync is changed.
     --scan-progress Print a message for each found image while scanning the
                     file system.
     --sections      Print in machine readable sections and parameter lines.
                     Read https://wit.wiimm.de/opt/sections for more details.
  -L --logging       This debug option enables the logging of internal memory
                     maps. If set twice second level memory maps are printed
                     too.

  -t --test          Run in test mode, modify nothing.
                     >>> USE THIS OPTION IF UNSURE! <<<

     --enc encoding  Define the encoding mode. The mode is one of NONE,
                     HASHONLY, DECRYPT, ENCRYPT, SIGN or AUTO. The case of the
                     keywords is ignored. The default mode is 'AUTO'.
     --modify list   This patching option defines the impact of the options
                     --name and --id. It expects a comma separated list of the
                     following keywords (case ignored) as parameter: NONE,
                     DISC, BOOT, TICKET, TMD, WBFS, TT, ALL and AUTO (default).
                       All keywords can be prefixed by '+' to enable that
                     option, by a '-' to disable it or by a '=' to enable that
                     option and disable all others.
     --name name     This patching option changes the name (disc title) of the
                     disc to the given parameter. Up to 63 characters are
                     expected. The disc header and boot.bin are objects to
                     modify. The option --modify selects the objects.
     --id id         This patching option changes the ID of the disc to the
                     given parameter. 1 to 6 characters are expected. Only
                     defined characters not equal '.' are modified. The plus
                     sign '+' is a wildcard for multiple '.' to fill the
                     complete entered ID to 6 characters. The disc header,
                     boot.bin, ticket.bin and tmd.bin are objects to modify.
                     The option --modify selects the objects.
                     See https://wit.wiimm.de/opt/id for more details.
     --disc-id id    This patching option changes the ID of the disc header to
                     the given parameter. 1 to 6 characters are expected. Only
                     defined characters not equal '.' are modified. The plus
                     sign '+' is a wildcard for multiple '.' to fill the
                     complete entered ID to 6 characters. Option --disc-id
                     overrides the definition of option --id.
                     See https://wit.wiimm.de/opt/disc-id for more details.
     --boot-id id    This patching option changes the ID of boot.bin to the
                     given parameter. 1 to 6 characters are expected. Only
                     defined characters not equal '.' are modified. The plus
                     sign '+' is a wildcard for multiple '.' to fill the
                     complete entered ID to 6 characters. Option --boot-id
                     overrides the definition of option --id.
                     See https://wit.wiimm.de/opt/boot-id for more details.
     --ticket-id id  This patching option changes the ID of ticket.bin to the
                     given parameter. 1 to 4 characters are expected. Only
                     defined characters not equal '.' are modified. The plus
                     sign '+' is a wildcard for multiple '.' to fill the
                     complete entered ID to 4 characters. Option --ticket-id
                     overrides the definition of option --id.
                     See https://wit.wiimm.de/opt/ticket-id for more details.
     --tmd-id id     This patching option changes the ID of tmd.bin to the
                     given parameter. 1 to 4 characters are expected. Only
                     defined characters not equal '.' are modified. The plus
                     sign '+' is a wildcard for multiple '.' to fill the
                     complete entered ID to 4 characters. Option --tmd-id
                     overrides the definition of option --id.
                     See https://wit.wiimm.de/opt/tmd-id for more details.
     --tt-id id      This is a short cut for '--ticket id --tmd id'. If TICKET
                     and TMD differ, the game will freeze after loading. So it
                     makes only sense to change TICKET and TMD IDs together.
     --wbfs-id id    This patching option changes the ID of the WBFS header to
                     the given parameter if adding a file to a WBFS or if
                     creating a WBFS file. 1 to 6 characters are expected. The
                     already patched disc ID of the source is used as base and
                     only defined characters not equal '.' are modified. The
                     plus sign '+' is a wildcard for multiple '.' to fill the
                     complete entered ID to 6 characters. Option --wbfs-id
                     overrides the definition of option --id.
                     See https://wit.wiimm.de/opt/wbfs-id for more details.
     --region region This patching option defines the region of the disc. The
                     region is one of JAPAN, USA, EUROPE, KOREA, FILE or AUTO
                     (default). The case of the keywords is ignored. Unsigned
                     numbers are also accepted.
     --common-key index 
                     This patching option defines the common key index as part
                     of the TICKET. Keywords 0, STANDARD, 1 and KOREAN are
                     accepted.
     --ios ios       This patching option defines the system version (IOS to
                     load) within TMD. The format is 'HIGH:LOW' or 'HIGH-LOW'
                     or 'LOW'. If only LOW is set than HIGH is assumed as 1
                     (standard IOS).
     --http          This patching option replaces 'https' request to 'http' in
                     the files 'main.dol' and 'rel/StaticR.rel', if the files
                     exist. It also replaces the sub-domain 'naswii' to 'nas'.
     --domain domain This patching option replaces the domain
                     'nintendowifi.net' by the new domain. The length of the
                     new domain must not be larger than the old length (16
                     characters).
                       If the new domain length is not larger than 11, then
                     'gamespy.com' of 'sake.gamespy.com' is replaced too.  This
                     is a special support for 'Super Smash Bros. Brawl'.
     --security-fix  Try to fix a security bug in the game. This is game
                     dependent.
     --wiimmfi       Patch the images for Wiimmfi, the new custom server. It is
                     a short cut for '--http --domain wiimmfi.de
                     --security-fix'.
     --rm-files ruleset 
                     This patching option defines filter rules to remove real
                     files and directories from the FST of the DATA partition.
                     Fake signing of the TMD is necessary. The processing order
                     of file options is: '--rm-files --zero-files
                     --ignore-files'.
                       See https://wit.wiimm.de/info/file-filter.html for more
                     details about file filters.
     --zero-files ruleset 
                     This patching option defines filter rules to zero (set
                     size to zero) real files of the FST of the DATA partition.
                     Fake signing of the TMD is necessary. The processing order
                     of file options is: '--rm-files --zero-files
                     --ignore-files'.
                       See https://wit.wiimm.de/info/file-filter.html for more
                     details about file filters.
     --ignore-files ruleset 
                     This option defines filter rules to ignore real files of
                     the FST of the DATA partition. Fake signing is not
                     necessary, but the partition becomes invalid, because the
                     content of some files is not copied. If such file is
                     accessed the Wii will halt immediately, because the
                     verification of the checksum calculation fails. The
                     processing order of file options is: '--rm-files
                     --zero-files --ignore-files'.
                       See https://wit.wiimm.de/info/file-filter.html for more
                     details about file filters.
     --align-part size 
                     If creating or moving partitions the beginning of each
                     partition is set to an offset that is a multiple of the
                     align size. Size must be a power of 2 and at least 32 KiB
                     (=default).
     --align-files   If creating a partition the file 'align-files.txt' is
                     read. Files listed with values >=0x8000 (Wii sector size)
                     are automatically aligned to 0x8000.
     --psel list     This option set the scrubbing mode and defines, which disc
                     partitions are handled. It expects a comma separated list
                     of keywords, numbers and names; all together called
                     parameter. All parameters are case insensitive and non
                     ambiguous abbreviations of keywords are allowed.
                       Each parameter becomes a rule and each rule is appended
                     to a rule list. Rules prefixed by a minus sign are DENY
                     rules. Rules prefixed by a plus sign or without a prefix
                     are ALLOW rules. Each partition is compared with each rule
                     until a rule matches the partition. If a match it found,
                     the partition is enabled for a ALLOW rule or disabled for
                     a DENY rule.
                       The allowed keywords are: DATA, UPDATE, CHANNEL, PTAB0
                     .. PTAB3, ID, ALL, WHOLE and RAW. The following input
                     formats are accepted too: ptype, #index, #<index,
                     #<=index, #>index, #>=index and #tab_index.part_index.
                       See https://wit.wiimm.de/opt/psel for more details.
     --raw           Abbreviation of '--psel RAW'.

  -R --remove        Remove source files/discs if operation is successful. If
                     the source is an extracted file systems (FST) it isn't
                     removed.
     --trunc         Truncate WBFS until operation finished.
  -e --newer         If source and destination have valid mtimes: Copy only if
                     source is newer.

 The ADD command adds all given ISO images to all given WBFS partitions. The
 filename '-' means 'read from stdin'. The three options --all, --auto and
 --part decides which partitions will be modified (see section "Options in
 detail: partitions" for details).

 If a given file does not exist or isn't a ISO image (maybe shrinked with WDF)
 an error message will be printed. The option --ignore suppresses this message.
 ADD accept plain ISO files, WDF ISO files, WBFS files and directories as
 source. For a directory each valid ISO file is used as source. The option
 --recurse allow a definition of a directory which is search recursive.

 Existing WBFS discs will be ignored if --update is set. They are only over-
 written if the option --overwrite is set. After successfull operation and if
 --remove is set, the ISO images will be removed from the source file system.

 If option --sync is set than before adding all discs that are not part of
 the soruce list are removed from the WBFS. The option --sync includes
 the option --update. After operation the WBFS contains exactly the ISO images
 which ae defined in the source list.

 If the option --newer is set and source and destination 'mtime' (last modi-
 fication time) for the current job are both available and non zero, then the
 options --update and --overwrite are ignored and the destination is over-
 written if the source is newer (younger) than the destination.
 
 If the --quiet option is set only error messages will be printed.
 If the --verbose option is set run time calculations will be made too.
 If the --verbose option is at least twice a progress status will be shown.

 If the --test option is set the programm does nothing, neither copying nor
 removing. Instead it will print some 'WOULD ...' messages.

 Before modifying the WBFS a check (see CHECK) is done. If there are any
 problematic errors detected the WBFS is ignored. If the option --force is set,
 the test is done but the result is ignored. The option --no-check disables
 this automatic check.

 The DUMP command dumps out the data structure of all WBFS. data. The three
 options --all, --auto and --part decides where partitions will be searched
 (see section "Options in detail: partitions" for details).

 If at least one parameter ('wbfs_partition') is given ther option --all well
 be enabled and all names are insterted into the partition list like --auto.
 This enables an easy lookup like 'wwt find *.wbfs'.

 DUMP will dumps the data structure of all WBFS partitions found. If the
 option --long is set then all Wii discs of each WBFS partition will be dumped
 too. If option --long is set at least twice an additional memory map for each
 disc will be printed. If --long is set at least three times an additional
 memory map for the whole WBFS is printed at the end. Failures (overlapped
 areas) are marked with '!'.

 If the option --inode is set, all inodes (invalid inodes with with proper
 inforamtions too) are shown. This implies at least one --long. When --long
 is four or more times the option --inode is set automatically.

 EDIT is a dangerous command. It let you (de-)activate the disc slots and
 edit the block assignments. Exact 1 WBFS must be specified. All parameters
 are sub commands. Modifications are only done if option --force is set.

     **********************************************************
     *****  WARNING: This command can damage your WBFS!!  *****
     **********************************************************

 Each parameter is one sub command. The case of commands is ignored. After
 editing a check of the WBFS is made and a status printed if errors found.
 The general subcommand syntax is:

    subcommand=parameter[,parameter]...

 List of subcommands:

   RM=a,b-c,...
   R=a,b-c,...
      Remove disc in slot 'a' or the slot range 'b-c' from wbfs. The slot is
      only marked as free, no blocks are freed. EDIT does not allow undefined
      slot numbers. The indices are null based.

   ACT=a,b-c,...
   A=a,b-c,...
      Activate disc in slot 'a' or the slot range 'b-c' from wbfs. The slot 
      is only marked as activated without any tests. EDIT does not allow
      undefined slot numbers. The indices are null based.

   INV=a,b-c,...
   I=a,b-c,...
      Like 'ACT' but the slot is additionally marked as invalid.

   FREE=a,b-c,...
   F=a,b-c,...
      Modify the free blocks table and mark the single block 'a' or the range
      of blocks 'b-c' as free.  EDIT does not allow undefined block numbers.

   USE=a,b-c,...
   U=a,b-c,...
      Modify the free blocks table and mark the single block 'a' or the range
      of blocks 'b-c' as used. EDIT does not allow undefined block numbers.

   ID6=a:b,c-d:e,...
      For the game with ID6:
         Set ISO block 'a' to WBFS block 'b' or set ISO blocks 'c-d' to WBFS
         blocks 'e...'. If 'e' is zero then set ISO blocks 'c-d' to zero
         (=unused). EDIT does not allow undefined block numbers.

 Note: The block size for all sub commands is always the WBFS block size,
       but never the ISO block size.

                     for '--job-limit 1'.
     --job-limit num Execute only the first 'num' jobs and exit. If done
                     without errors the exit status is OK (zero).

  -q --quiet         Be quiet and print only error messages.
  -v --verbose       Show a runtime summary for each job. If set twice enable
                     progress information. If set three times the progress
                     information is more detailed.
  -P --progress      Print progress counter. If --verbose is set at least
                     twice, printing is enabled too. If progress is enabled,
                     the default of --dsync is changed.
     --scan-progress Print a message for each found image while scanning the
                     file system.
  -l --long          Print a summary line while extracting files. If set at
                     least twice, print a status line for each extracted files.
     --sections      Print in machine readable sections and parameter lines.
                     Read https://wit.wiimm.de/opt/sections for more details.

  -t --test          Run in test mode, modify nothing.
                     >>> USE THIS OPTION IF UNSURE! <<<

  -d --dest path     Define a destination path (directory or file). The
                     destination path is scanned for escape sequences (see
                     option --esc) to allow generic paths.
  -D --DEST path     Like --dest, but create the directory path automatically.
  -E --esc char      Define an alternative escape character for destination
                     files. The default is '%'. For Windows (CYGWIN) it is a
                     good choice to set '-E$' to avoid conflicts with command
                     shell variables.
     --auto-split    Enable auto split modus: Split only if necessary and
                     determine the split size automatically.
                       THIS OPTION IS EXPERIMENTAL. In future versions it
                     becomes the default.
     --no-split      Disable output file splitting. This is the default, but in
                     future versions, the new option --auto-split becomes the
                     default.
  -z --split         Enable output file splitting. The default split size is 4
                     GB.
  -Z --split-size sz Enable output file splitting and define a split size. The
                     parameter 'sz' is a floating point number followed by an
                     optional unit factor (one of 'cb' [=1] or 'kmgtpe'
                     [base=1000] or 'KMGTPE' [base=1024]). The default unit is
                     'G' (GiB).
     --disc-size size 
                     Define a minimal (virtual) ISO disc size.
     --prealloc=[=mode] 
                     This option enables or disables the disc space
                     preallocation. If enabled the tools try to allocate disc
                     space for the new files before writing the data. This
                     reduces the fragmentation but also disables the sparse
                     effect for preallocated areas.
                       The optional parameter decides the preallocation mode:
                     OFF (or 0), SMART (or 1), ALL (or 2). If no parameter is
                     set, ALL is used.
                       Mode 'OFF' disables the preallocation. Mode 'SMART'
                     looks into the source disc to find out the writing areas.
                     SMART is only available for ISO, CISO and WBFS file types.
                     For other file types ALL is used instead. Mode 'ALL' (the
                     default) preallocate the whole destination file. Because
                     of the large holes in plain ISO images, the SMART mode is
                     used for ISOs instead.
     --trunc         Truncate PLAIN ISO and WBFS images after creating or
                     copying to the minimal needed size with respect to the
                     block size.
     --chunk-mode mode 
                     Defines an operation mode for --chunk-size and
                     --max-chunks. Allowed keywords are 'ANY' to allow any
                     values, '32K' to force chunk sizes with a multiple of 32
                     KiB, 'POW2' to force chunk sizes >=32K and with a power of
                     2 or 'ISO' for ISO images (more restrictive as 'POW2',
                     best for USB loaders). The case of the keyword is ignored.
                     The default key is 'ISO'.
                       --chm is a shortcut for --chunk-mode.
     --chunk-size sz Define the minimal chunk size if creating a CISO or WIA
                     file (for WIA details see option --compression}). The
                     default is to calculate the chunk size from the input file
                     size and find a good value by using a minimal value of 1
                     MiB for '--chunk-mode ISO' and 32 KiB for modes 32K and
                     POW2. For the modes ISO and POW2 the value is rounded up
                     to the next power of 2. This calculation also depends from
                     option --max-chunks.
                       The parameter 'sz' is a floating point number followed
                     by an optional unit factor (one of 'cb' [=1] or 'kmgtpe'
                     [base=1000] or 'KMGTPE' [base=1024]). The default unit is
                     'M' (MiB). If the number is prefixed with a '=' then
                     options --chunk-mode and --max-chunks are ignored and the
                     given value is used without any rounding or changing.
                       If the input file size is not known (e.g. reading from
                     pipe), its size is assumed as 12 GiB.
                       --chs is a shortcut for --chunk-size.
     --max-chunks n  Define the maximal number of chunks if creating a CISO
                     file. The default value is 8192 for '--chunk-mode ISO' and
                     32760 (maximal value) for all other modes. If this value
                     is set than the automatic calculation of --chunk-size will
                     be modified too.
                       --mch is a shortcut for --max-chunks.

     --enc encoding  Define the encoding mode. The mode is one of NONE,
                     HASHONLY, DECRYPT, ENCRYPT, SIGN or AUTO. The case of the
                     keywords is ignored. The default mode is 'AUTO'.
     --modify list   This patching option defines the impact of the options
                     --name and --id. It expects a comma separated list of the
                     following keywords (case ignored) as parameter: NONE,
                     DISC, BOOT, TICKET, TMD, WBFS, TT, ALL and AUTO (default).
                       All keywords can be prefixed by '+' to enable that
                     option, by a '-' to disable it or by a '=' to enable that
                     option and disable all others.
     --name name     This patching option changes the name (disc title) of the
                     disc to the given parameter. Up to 63 characters are
                     expected. The disc header and boot.bin are objects to
                     modify. The option --modify selects the objects.
     --id id         This patching option changes the ID of the disc to the
                     given parameter. 1 to 6 characters are expected. Only
                     defined characters not equal '.' are modified. The plus
                     sign '+' is a wildcard for multiple '.' to fill the
                     complete entered ID to 6 characters. The disc header,
                     boot.bin, ticket.bin and tmd.bin are objects to modify.
                     The option --modify selects the objects.
                     See https://wit.wiimm.de/opt/id for more details.
     --disc-id id    This patching option changes the ID of the disc header to
                     the given parameter. 1 to 6 characters are expected. Only
                     defined characters not equal '.' are modified. The plus
                     sign '+' is a wildcard for multiple '.' to fill the
                     complete entered ID to 6 characters. Option --disc-id
                     overrides the definition of option --id.
                     See https://wit.wiimm.de/opt/disc-id for more details.
     --boot-id id    This patching option changes the ID of boot.bin to the
                     given parameter. 1 to 6 characters are expected. Only
                     defined characters not equal '.' are modified. The plus
                     sign '+' is a wildcard for multiple '.' to fill the
                     complete entered ID to 6 characters. Option --boot-id
                     overrides the definition of option --id.
                     See https://wit.wiimm.de/opt/boot-id for more details.
     --ticket-id id  This patching option changes the ID of ticket.bin to the
                     given parameter. 1 to 4 characters are expected. Only
                     defined characters not equal '.' are modified. The plus
                     sign '+' is a wildcard for multiple '.' to fill the
                     complete entered ID to 4 characters. Option --ticket-id
                     overrides the definition of option --id.
                     See https://wit.wiimm.de/opt/ticket-id for more details.
     --tmd-id id     This patching option changes the ID of tmd.bin to the
                     given parameter. 1 to 4 characters are expected. Only
                     defined characters not equal '.' are modified. The plus
                     sign '+' is a wildcard for multiple '.' to fill the
                     complete entered ID to 4 characters. Option --tmd-id
                     overrides the definition of option --id.
                     See https://wit.wiimm.de/opt/tmd-id for more details.
     --tt-id id      This is a short cut for '--ticket id --tmd id'. If TICKET
                     and TMD differ, the game will freeze after loading. So it
                     makes only sense to change TICKET and TMD IDs together.
     --wbfs-id id    This patching option changes the ID of the WBFS header to
                     the given parameter if adding a file to a WBFS or if
                     creating a WBFS file. 1 to 6 characters are expected. The
                     already patched disc ID of the source is used as base and
                     only defined characters not equal '.' are modified. The
                     plus sign '+' is a wildcard for multiple '.' to fill the
                     complete entered ID to 6 characters. Option --wbfs-id
                     overrides the definition of option --id.
                     See https://wit.wiimm.de/opt/wbfs-id for more details.
     --region region This patching option defines the region of the disc. The
                     region is one of JAPAN, USA, EUROPE, KOREA, FILE or AUTO
                     (default). The case of the keywords is ignored. Unsigned
                     numbers are also accepted.
     --common-key index 
                     This patching option defines the common key index as part
                     of the TICKET. Keywords 0, STANDARD, 1 and KOREAN are
                     accepted.
     --ios ios       This patching option defines the system version (IOS to
                     load) within TMD. The format is 'HIGH:LOW' or 'HIGH-LOW'
                     or 'LOW'. If only LOW is set than HIGH is assumed as 1
                     (standard IOS).
     --http          This patching option replaces 'https' request to 'http' in
                     the files 'main.dol' and 'rel/StaticR.rel', if the files
                     exist. It also replaces the sub-domain 'naswii' to 'nas'.
     --domain domain This patching option replaces the domain
                     'nintendowifi.net' by the new domain. The length of the
                     new domain must not be larger than the old length (16
                     characters).
                       If the new domain length is not larger than 11, then
                     'gamespy.com' of 'sake.gamespy.com' is replaced too.  This
                     is a special support for 'Super Smash Bros. Brawl'.
     --security-fix  Try to fix a security bug in the game. This is game
                     dependent.
     --wiimmfi       Patch the images for Wiimmfi, the new custom server. It is
                     a short cut for '--http --domain wiimmfi.de
                     --security-fix'.
     --rm-files ruleset 
                     This patching option defines filter rules to remove real
                     files and directories from the FST of the DATA partition.
                     Fake signing of the TMD is necessary. The processing order
                     of file options is: '--rm-files --zero-files
                     --ignore-files'.
                       See https://wit.wiimm.de/info/file-filter.html for more
                     details about file filters.
     --zero-files ruleset 
                     This patching option defines filter rules to zero (set
                     size to zero) real files of the FST of the DATA partition.
                     Fake signing of the TMD is necessary. The processing order
                     of file options is: '--rm-files --zero-files
                     --ignore-files'.
                       See https://wit.wiimm.de/info/file-filter.html for more
                     details about file filters.
     --psel list     This option set the scrubbing mode and defines, which disc
                     partitions are handled. It expects a comma separated list
                     of keywords, numbers and names; all together called
                     parameter. All parameters are case insensitive and non
                     ambiguous abbreviations of keywords are allowed.
                       Each parameter becomes a rule and each rule is appended
                     to a rule list. Rules prefixed by a minus sign are DENY
                     rules. Rules prefixed by a plus sign or without a prefix
                     are ALLOW rules. Each partition is compared with each rule
                     until a rule matches the partition. If a match it found,
                     the partition is enabled for a ALLOW rule or disabled for
                     a DENY rule.
                       The allowed keywords are: DATA, UPDATE, CHANNEL, PTAB0
                     .. PTAB3, ID, ALL, WHOLE and RAW. The following input
                     formats are accepted too: ptype, #index, #<index,
                     #<=index, #>index, #>=index and #tab_index.part_index.
                       See https://wit.wiimm.de/opt/psel for more details.
     --raw           Abbreviation of '--psel RAW'.

  -W --wdf=[=param]  Set the image output file type to WDF (Wii Disc Format).
                     The output format is either WDFv1 or WDFv2 (default). It
                     depends of the input file format and of the aligning.
                     --wdf=param is a short cut for '--wdf --align-wdf=param'.
  -I --iso           Set image output file type to PLAIN ISO.
  -C --ciso          Set image output file type to CISO (Compact ISO, same as
                     WBI).
  -B --wbfs          Set image output file type to WBFS (Wii Backup File
                     System, default).
     --wia=[=compr]  Set image output file type to WIA (Wii ISO Archive). The
                     optional parameter is a compression mode and --wia=mode is
                     a shortcut for '--wia --compression mode'.
     --gcz           Set image output file type to GCZ (Dolphins GameCube Zip).
     --gcz-zip       If creating a GCZ image, a blockwise z-compression is
                     tried. If the compressed data is larger than 98.5%, the
                     uncompressed data is stored. Encrypted blocks are stored
                     directly as uncompressed data, because the 98.5% test
                     fails all the time.
                       Option --gcz-zip disables this optimization for
                     encrypted data and makes the creation process slower.
     --gcz-block size 
                     The value defines the block size, if creating a GCZ image.
                     The default is 16K (also Dolphins default). Smaller values
                     enlarge the managment data and reduce the compression
                     ratio. Use the option with caution!
     --fst=param     Set image output mode to 'file system' (extracted ISO).
     --pmode p-mode  This options set the prefix mode for listed or extracted
                     files. One of the following values is allowed: AUTO, NONE,
                     POINT, ID, NAME, INDEX, COMBI. The default value is
                     'AUTO'. See https://wit.wiimm.de/opt/pmode for more
                     details.
     --flat          While extracting a disc image strip all path names of the
                     source file and store all files in the same directory.
                     This option sets the default for --pmode to NONE.
     --files=ruleset Append file select rules. This option can be used multiple
                     times to extend the rule list. Rules beginning with a '+'
                     or a '-' are allow or deny rules rules. Rules beginning

 The command 'FILETYPE' prints for each given file one status line like:
    FILETYPE ID6 SIZE_MIB REGION SPLIT FILENAME
 Columns 'ID6' and 'SPLIT' are only printed if option --long is set. For non
 ISO images the ID6 is '-'. If the file is splitted than column 'SPLIT' shows
 the number of split files instead of '-'. Columns 'SIZE_MIB' and 'REGION'
 are only printed if option --long is set at least two times.

 'SIZE_MIB' is the calculatet size of a scrubbed ISO image. For this all used
 sectors of a ISO image are counted. The usage depends of the options --psel
 and --raw.

 Filetypes are:
    NO-FILE  : No file found
    DIR      : Not a file but a directory
    WBFS     : A WBFS
    WBFS/    : A WBFS used like directory with id6 or index or pos
    WDF+WBFS : A WBFS shrinked with WDF (this make no sense expect transporting)
    ISO      : A ISO image.
    WDF+ISO  : A ISO image shrinked with WDF.
    WDF      : Any other WDF file (not WBFS or ISO)
    WIA      : A ISO image packed into the WIA (Wii ISO Archive). 
    GCZ      : Dolphins GameCup-Zip images.
    OTHER    : Any other file

 Remark: The test for WBFS is poor and must be improved.


 Usual ERROR/EXIT CODES:

 The FIND command makes a quick search for WBFS partitions: it scans only the
 WBFS-Header. The three options --all, --auto and --part decides where partitions
 will be searched (see section "Options in detail: partitions" for details).

 If at least one parameter ('wbfs_partition') is given the option --all will be
 enabled and all names are inserted into the partition list like --auto.
 This enables an easy lookup like 'wwt find *.wbfs'.

 Without option --long only a list of found WBFS partition will print out,
 each partition in one line.

 With a single --long option an aligned list of all partitions, wbfs or not,
 is printed with 5 colums:
    type       : 'PLAIN' for plain files or 'BLOCK' for block devices.
    wbfs       : 'WBFS' or '--'
    disc usage : allocated size in MiB.
    size       : file size in MiB.
    file       : the given path name of the file.
 The option --no-header suppress the output of header and footer.

 With a double (or more) --long option the layout is changed:
    type       : 'PLAIN' for plain files or 'BLOCK' for block devices.
    wbfs       : 'WBFS' or '--'
    disc usage : allocated size in MiB.
    size       : file size in bytes.
    full path  : the real path name of the file.
 The option --no-header suppress the output of header and footer.

 The 'disc usage' is smaller than the 'file length' if the file contains holes
 (sparse files). For block devices it is always printed as zero.

 If the option --quiet is set then FIND is absolut quiet. If at least one of
 the examined partitions or files is a valid WBFS then the return status is
 'OK' (0). If none is a WBFS the return status is 'NO WBFS FOUND' (not null).

 
 Usual ERROR/EXIT CODES:

    0 == OK             : all done without errors.
    SYNTAX ERROR        : at least one syntax error in command line found.
    READ ERROR          : error while read a file given by option --part.
    NO WBFS FOUND       : no WBFS partition found.
    TO MUCH WBFS FOUND  : 2 to more no WBFS partition found but --all missed.

     --no-utf-8     Disables UTF-8 support for filenames.
     --lang lang    Define the language for titles.

  -v --verbose      Be verbose and explain the actions.
  -s --size size    Define then total size of a WBFS file. 'size' is a floating
                    number optionally followed by one of the single letter
                    factors 'kKmMgGtT'. This value is only used while creating
                    a new WBFS file.
  -z --split        Enable output file splitting. The default split size is 4
                    GB.
  -Z --split-size sz 
                    Enable output file splitting and define a split size. The
                    parameter 'sz' is a floating point number followed by an
                    optional unit factor (one of 'cb' [=1] or 'kmgtpe'
                    [base=1000] or 'KMGTPE' [base=1024]). The default unit is
                    'G' (GiB).
     --hss size     Define HD sector size. The parameter 'size' is a floating
                    point number followed by an optional unit factor (one of
                    'cb' [=1] or 'kmgtpe' [base=1000] or 'KMGTPE' [base=1024]).
                    Only power of 2 values larger or equal 512 are accepted.
                    The default value is 512.
     --wss size     Define WBFS sector size. The parameter 'size' is a floating
                    point number followed by an optional unit factor (one of
                    'cb' [=1] or 'kmgtpe' [base=1000] or 'KMGTPE' [base=1024]).
                    Only power of 2 values larger or equal 1024 are accepted.
                    If not set the WBFS sector size is calculated
                    automatically.
     --recover      Format a WBFS in recover mode: Write the WBFS sector, but
                    don't reset the disc info area. Then look into each disc
                    slot to find valid discs and restore them.
     --inode        Force creating inode infos with predefined timestamps. The
                    timestamps reduce effect of sparse files. This option is
                    set for devices automatically.

  -t --test         Force test mode and ignore --force.
  -f --force        This option is needed for leaving test mode and for real
                    formatting!

 The command FORMAT format block devices and plain files with a WBFS. All data
 on the destination will be lost.

 The command works in test mode if the option --test is set or the option
 --force is not set. So you must set the option --force to format.

 The option --size is irrelevant for already existing files. Non existing
 files will be created as sparse files. Therefor the option --size is needed.
 The option needs a integer number and an optional factor sign.

 The option --hss defines the HD sector size of the WBFS partition. The default
 is 512 bytes and most other tools and USB loaders will only support this 512.
 But the wbfs framwork supports any value >=16 but it must be a power of 2.
 WWT forces values >= 512.

 The option --wss defines the WBFS sector size. If not set the INIT function
 calculates a good value.
 
 The parameters of the size options --size and --sector-size are discussed in
 the section "Processing size options".

 If the option --recover is set, the WBFS will be formatted in recover mode:
  - If --hss or --wss is not set then an internal call to ANALYZE (output
    suppressed) is made to determine the values. The data of the first
    virtual row is used to override the default values of --hss and --wss.
  - Only the header of the WBFS is written. The inodes are not cleared.
  - All empty discs slots are marked as used.
  - All WBFS blocks are marked as used.
  - A silent check and repair is done:
     - Drop discs with invalid magic or without ID.
     - Drop rescued discs with invalid block numbers. (--repair=RM-INVALID)
     - Drop rescued discs without any block. (--repair=RM-EMPTY)
     - Free unused blocks in the free blocks table. (--repair=FBT)
  - A verbose check is done (like "wwt check --verbose") to find and report
    other errors.

 WARNING:
    Before using "wwt INIT --recover" you should call "wwt ANALYZE" and
    control the output!

 The command 'ID6' lists the ID6 of all discs for each partition, one ID per row.
 The three options --all, --auto and --part decides where partitions
 will be searched (see section "Options in detail: partitions" for details).

 If neither --part nor --auto is set then the options --auto and --all are
 assumed. So the usage of 'id6' without options is easy.

 If --uniqe is set each game disc with same ID6, name, size and region is only
 printed once. The --unique option implies the --all option.

 The sort order can be set by the --sort option. Sort=none means, that the ID
 will be shown in order of the WBFS partition. The default sort order is 'ID'.

 If the option --long is set the output is "WBFS_FILE/ID6" for each game.

 The command 'LIST' lists infos of all discs for each partition, one disc per
 row. The three options --all, --auto and --part decides where partitions will
 be searched (see section "Options in detail: partitions" for details).

 If neither --part nor --auto is set then thr options --auto and --all are
 assumed. So the usage of 'list' without options is easy.

 Without --long the ID and the name are printed. With option --long the ID,
 size, region and the name are printed.  The option --no-header suppress the
 output of header and footer.

 Printing of timestamps is enabled by the options --time, --itime, --mtime
 --ctime, --atime or when --long is set at least twice. --time=off disables
 time printing. All time options (not --long) supersede the previous options.
 The option --time take a comma separated list of the following keywords:

    OFF    : Disable time printing. All other option enable time printing.
    ON     : Enable time printing.

    SINGLE : Print only a single column (last time specified.
    MULTI  : Print columns for all specified times. (default)

    I      : Use itime (insertion time) for processing.
    M      : Use mtime (last modicifaction time) for processing. (default)
    C      : Use ctime (last staus change time) for processing.
    A      : Use atime (last access time) for processing.

    NONE   : Disable all 4 times above
    ALL    : Enable all 4 times above
    
    DATE   : Print time in format 'YYYY-MM-DD'. (default)
    TIME   : Print time in format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM'.
    MIN    : Alternative keyword for 'TIME'.
    SEC    : Print time in format 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'.

    *DATE  : Short cut for '*,DATE'. '*' is one of 'I', 'M', 'C' or 'A'.
    *TIME  : Short cut for '*,TIME'. '*' is one of 'I', 'M', 'C' or 'A'.
    *MIN   : Alternative keywords for '*TIME'.
    *SEC   : Short cut for '*,SEC'.  '*' is one of 'I', 'M', 'C' or 'A'.

 With --mixed all discs of all partitions were mixed together. If --uniqe is
 set each game disc identified by ID6 is only printet once. The --mixed option
 implies the --all option. The --unique option implies the --mixed and the
 --all options.

 If the option --long is set three or more time together with --mixed then a
 WBFS table is printed at the top with a WBFS-Index ('WI') and the filename.
 The game table contains an additional column with this WBFS-Index.

 If the option --sections is set, then the layout is completly changed to a
 sections base output. This output is machine readable. The output looks like:

        [section_name-index]
        parameter=value
        parameter=value
        ...

 The sort order can be set by the --sort option. Sort=none means, that the ID
 will be shown in order of the WBFS partition. The default sort order is
 'TITLE'.

 If available the name of the title database is used as game name. use the
 option -T0 to disable database titles.

wwt PHANTOM : Add NUM phantom discs with entered SIZE (default unit 'g') with a
              generic ID6 ('PHT###' where '###' is the smallest not already
              used integer). If NUM and/or SIZE are ranges use random values
              from this range.
                Phantom discs have no content and only a header is written.
              This makes adding discs very fast and this is good for testing.
              The creation process stops if the WBFS becomes full. In this
              case, the last added image may be shorter as planned.

 The PHANTOM commands adds multiple discs to WBFS partitions. The content of
 the discs is undefined, only the WBFS inode and the ISO header (first 256
 bytes) are written to  WBFS. The PHANTOM command is implemented for test
 purposes; it can fill a WBFS very fast with multiple discs with random size.

 The ID6 of phantom discs are 'PHT###', where '###' is the lowest unused
 decimal number.

 The syntax of each subcommand is: [ NUM 'x' ] SIZE ['m'|'g']

 NUM defines a number of discs to add. NUM is a unsigned integer or a range
 like '2-5'. If a range is given, wwt add a random number of discs specified
 by this range. The default number is '1'

 SIZE defines the size of the discs in GiB. SIZE is a unsigned integer or a
 range like '1-9'. If a range is given, wwt calculates the real size
 as random number in the specified discs. If a 'm' (or 'M') is follows the
 size, SIZE is specified in MiB and not in GiB.

 Example: wwt PHANTOM 3-5x1-9
    create 3, 4 or 5 discs, each with a random size between 1 and 9 GiB.

 Multiple subcommands are allowed. The program terminates the filling
 process automatically and without errors if the WBFS becomes full.
 Full means that are slots are used or that no more data space is left.
 If the data space runs out the last phantom will be cutted silently
 so that all data blocks in the WBFS are used.

 Before modifying the WBFS a check (see CHECK) is done. If there are any
 problematic errors detected the WBFS is ignored. If the option --force is
 set, the test is done but the result is ignored. The option --no-check
 disables this automatic check.


 Usual ERROR/EXIT CODES:

    0 == OK             : all done without errors.
    SYNTAX ERROR        : at least one syntax error in command line found.
    READ ERROR          : error while read a file given by option --part.

 The command RECOVER tries to recover presious removed discs. It recover only
 discs without block collisions (2 ore mor discs shares the same memory).

 Recovering work like this:
  - All empty discs slots are marked as used.
  - All WBFS blocks are marked as used.
  - A silent check and repair is done:
     - Drop discs with invalid magic or without ID.
     - Drop rescued discs with invalid block numbers. (--repair=RM-INVALID)
     - Drop rescued discs without any block. (--repair=RM-EMPTY)
     - Free unused blocks in the free blocks table. (--repair=FBT)
  - A verbose check is done (like "wwt check --verbose") to find and report
    other errors.

 The REMOVE command removes all discs identified by ID6 from all given WBFS
 partitions. The options --all, --auto and --part decides which partitions
 will be modified (see section "Options in detail: partitions" for details).

 Each parameter is scanned for an ID6. Possible formats are:
    '*' | '+'
    ID6
    ID6=name
    name [ID6]
    ID6 anything
 A single '*' (must be escaped by shells) or '+' means 'all'. A 'name' part
 will be ignored. Please read section "Processing ID6 parameters" for details.

 The option --ignore suppresses error messages about not found disc images.

 If the --quiet option is set only error messages will be printed.
 If the --verbose option is set run time claculations will be made too.

 If the --test option is set the programm does nothing, neither copying nor
 removing. Instead it will print some 'WOULD ...' messages.
 If the --test option is set two or more times then only a normalized ID6
 list is printed. For each ID6 one line is printed. If a destination
 filename is known 'ID=name' is printed, else 'ID6' alone.

 If the option --no-free is set then the disc is only marked as removed. The
 allocated blocks are not freed. After using --no-free you should use the
 command CHECK with --rapair=fbt to repair the free blocks table.

 Before modifying the WBFS a check (see CHECK) is done. If there are any
 problematic errors detected the WBFS is ignored. If the option --force is set,
 the test is done but the result is ignored. The option --no-check disables
 this automatic check.

                    The options --include, --include-path, --exclude and

 This command 'RENAME' may change the ID6 and/or the title of discs. It can
 change the information in the WBFS inode or the information in the ISO header
 or both (the default).

 The alternative command 'SETTITLE' modifies only titles. The advantage of
 'SETTITLE' is, that it can modify all titles with 1 sub command.

 The syntax of a sub command is: id6=[new_id6][,new_title]
    'id6' is the ID of the disc to change.
    The optional 'new_id6' is the new ID of the disc.
    The optional 'new_title' is the new title of the disc.

 Processing the new title:

    The title string is parsed for escape sequences beginning with the escape
    character '%'. The accepted format is:

        '%cX'  or  '%mcX'  or  '%n-mcX'

    'n' is the number of skipped characters of the field.

    'm' is the zero based index of the last copied character.

    'c' is an optional character. If c is 'u' then the source will be
        converted to uppercase and if c is 'l' to lower case.

    'X' selects the source and is one of:

        'i' : the (new) ID6
        'I' : the (new) ID6
        'j' : The previous ID stored in the WBFS inode.
        'J' : The previous ID stored in the ISO header.

        'n' : The previous disc title stored in the WBFS inode.
        'N' : The previous disc title stored in the ISO ehader.

        't' : The title from the title database based on the new ID or, if not
              changed, on the ID of the WBFS inode. If no title found the disc
              name stored in the WBFS inode is used.
        'T' : Same as 't'
        'p' : The title from the title database based on the previous ID stored
              in the WBFS inode. If no title found the disc name stored in the
              WBFS inode is used.
        'P' : The title from the title database based on the previous ID stored
              in the ISO header. If no title found the disc name stored in the
              ISO header is used.

        If the object to change is not a WBFS then the ISO data is used instead
        of the WBFS inode data ('j', 'n', and 'p' conversions).

    To use the '%' sign itself just type '%%'.

    Instead of '%' an alternative escape character can be used. It is defined
    by the option --esc. This makes live easier if using the cygwin version
    together with the windows shell 'cmd'. Define the environment variables
    'WIT_OPT' and/or 'WWT_OPT' for a new default definition.

 The SPACE command makes a quick search for WBFS partitions: it scans only the
 WBFS-Header. The three options --all, --auto and --part decides where partitions
 will be searched (see section "Options in detail: partitions" for details).

 If at least one parameter ('wbfs_partition') is given ther option --all well be
 enabled and all names are insterted into the partition list like --auto.
 This enables an easy lookup like 'wwt find *.wbfs'.

 The SPACE/DF command prints:
    size  : file size in MiB.
    used  : space used by discs in MiB.
    used% : space used by discs in percent.
    free  : free space for discs in MiB.
    discs : number of wii discs / max number of discs
    file  : the given path name of the file.

 With option --long the real path instead aa the given filename is printed.
 The option --no-header suppress the output of header and footer.

 Usual ERROR/EXIT CODES:

    0 == OK             : all done without errors.
    SYNTAX ERROR        : at least one syntax error in command line found.
    READ ERROR          : error while read a file given by option --part.

                     possible.
     --no-check      Disable automatic check of WBFS before modifications.

     --wbfs-alloc mode 
                     Select one WBFS block allocation modus:
                       FIRST: Use always the first free WBFS block. NO-FRAG:
                     Find large blocks to minimize fragmentation. AUTO
                     (=default): Use modus NO-FRAG for partitions >=20GiB and
                     modus FIRST for partitions <20GiB and for files.
     --source path   Use the entered file or directory as source.
                       If parameter PATH contains at least one wildcard (e.g.
                     '*.wbfs'), then PATH is used as search pattern and all
                     found files are added. In order to use this variant, the
                     calling shell must not interpret the wildcards. Therefore,
                     the parameter must usually be enclosed in single or double
                     quotes.
                       Directories are expanded to all containing files but
                     hidden files (file names begins with a point) are ignored.
                     If a command needs only images then non image files of the
                     directory are ignored without notification. The option
                     --no-expand suppress the directory expansion.
     --no-expand     Do not expand directories to the containing files or
                     images. This option does not change the behavior of
                     --recurse.
  -r --recurse path  If path is not a directory, then it is used as a simple
                     source file like --source.
                       If parameter PATH contains at least one wildcard (e.g.
                     '*.wbfs'), then PATH is used as search pattern and all
                     found files are added. In order to use this variant, the
                     calling shell must not interpret the wildcards. Therefore,
                     the parameter must usually be enclosed in single or double
                     quotes.
                       Directories are scanned for source files recursively.
                     The option --rdepth limits the search depth. Hidden files
                     and hidden sub directories (file names begins with a
                     point) and files with non supported file types (non ISO
                     files for most commands) are ignored without notification.
     --rdepth depth  Set the maximum recurse depth for option --recurse. The
                     default search depth is 10.
  -x --exclude id    A comma separated list with ID4 and ID6 values is
                     expected. '.' is a wildcard for exact 1 character and '+'
                     is a wildcard for any number characters. If the parameter
                     begins with a '@' the given file is read and each line is
                     scanned for one ID. Images with the given ID are excluded
                     from operation. Each use of this option expands the
                     exclude list. See --include-first for precedence issues.
  -X --exclude-path file_or_dir 
                     Scan the ID of the source and add it to the exclude list.
                     If the source is a directory then scan all images of the
                     directory. Images with the given ID are excluded from
                     operation. Each use of this option expands the exclude
                     list. See --include-first for precedence issues.
  -n --include id    A comma separated list with ID values is expected. '.' is
                     a wildcard for exact 1 character and '+' is a wildcard for
                     any number characters. If the parameter begins with a '@'
                     the given file is read and each line is scanned for one
                     ID. Only images with the given ID are included into the
                     operation. Each use of this option expands the include
                     list. See --include-first for precedence issues.
  -N --include-path file_or_dir 
                     Scan the ID of the source and add it to the include list.
                     If the source is a directory then scan all images of the
                     directory. Only images with the given ID are included into
                     the operation. Each use of this option expands the include
                     list. See --include-first for precedence issues.
     --include-first The options --include, --include-path, --exclude and
                     --exclude-path decide which discs are included into the
                     operation. If neither include nor exclude options are
                     used, than all disc are included into the operation. If
                     only include options are used, than only the specified
                     discs are operated. If only exclude options are used, than
                     all all discs but not the excluded are operated.
                       If include and exclude options are used together and
                     --include-first is not set, than all discs are operated
                     that are specified by any include option and not by any
                     exclude option. If --include-first is set, than all discs
                     are ignored that are specified by any exclude option and
                     not by any include option.
  -1 --one-job       Execute only the first job and exit. This is a shortcut
                     for '--job-limit 1'.
     --job-limit num Execute only the first 'num' jobs and exit. If done
                     without errors the exit status is OK (zero).
  -i --ignore        Ignore non existing files/discs without warning. If set
                     twice then all non Wii and GameCube ISO images are ignored
                     too.
     --ignore-fst    Disable composing and ignore FST directories as input.
                     This legacy option is a shortcut for --allow-fst=off.
     --ignore-setup  While composing ignore the file 'setup.txt', which defines
                     some partition parameters.
     --links         Detect soft and hard linked source files while composing
                     or extracting discs and try to create hard links instead
                     of independent copies on the destination file system.

  -q --quiet         Be quiet and print only error messages.
  -v --verbose       Show a runtime summary for each job. If set twice enable
                     progress information. If set three times the progress
                     information is more detailed.
  -P --progress      Print progress counter. If --verbose is set at least
                     twice, printing is enabled too. If progress is enabled,
                     the default of --dsync is changed.
     --scan-progress Print a message for each found image while scanning the
                     file system.
     --sections      Print in machine readable sections and parameter lines.
                     Read https://wit.wiimm.de/opt/sections for more details.
  -L --logging       This debug option enables the logging of internal memory
                     maps. If set twice second level memory maps are printed
                     too.

  -t --test          Run in test mode, modify nothing.
                     >>> USE THIS OPTION IF UNSURE! <<<

     --enc encoding  Define the encoding mode. The mode is one of NONE,
                     HASHONLY, DECRYPT, ENCRYPT, SIGN or AUTO. The case of the
                     keywords is ignored. The default mode is 'AUTO'.
     --modify list   This patching option defines the impact of the options
                     --name and --id. It expects a comma separated list of the
                     following keywords (case ignored) as parameter: NONE,
                     DISC, BOOT, TICKET, TMD, WBFS, TT, ALL and AUTO (default).
                       All keywords can be prefixed by '+' to enable that
                     option, by a '-' to disable it or by a '=' to enable that
                     option and disable all others.
     --name name     This patching option changes the name (disc title) of the
                     disc to the given parameter. Up to 63 characters are
                     expected. The disc header and boot.bin are objects to
                     modify. The option --modify selects the objects.
     --id id         This patching option changes the ID of the disc to the
                     given parameter. 1 to 6 characters are expected. Only
                     defined characters not equal '.' are modified. The plus
                     sign '+' is a wildcard for multiple '.' to fill the
                     complete entered ID to 6 characters. The disc header,
                     boot.bin, ticket.bin and tmd.bin are objects to modify.
                     The option --modify selects the objects.
                     See https://wit.wiimm.de/opt/id for more details.
     --disc-id id    This patching option changes the ID of the disc header to
                     the given parameter. 1 to 6 characters are expected. Only
                     defined characters not equal '.' are modified. The plus
                     sign '+' is a wildcard for multiple '.' to fill the
                     complete entered ID to 6 characters. Option --disc-id
                     overrides the definition of option --id.
                     See https://wit.wiimm.de/opt/disc-id for more details.
     --boot-id id    This patching option changes the ID of boot.bin to the
                     given parameter. 1 to 6 characters are expected. Only
                     defined characters not equal '.' are modified. The plus
                     sign '+' is a wildcard for multiple '.' to fill the
                     complete entered ID to 6 characters. Option --boot-id
                     overrides the definition of option --id.
                     See https://wit.wiimm.de/opt/boot-id for more details.
     --ticket-id id  This patching option changes the ID of ticket.bin to the
                     given parameter. 1 to 4 characters are expected. Only
                     defined characters not equal '.' are modified. The plus
                     sign '+' is a wildcard for multiple '.' to fill the
                     complete entered ID to 4 characters. Option --ticket-id
                     overrides the definition of option --id.
                     See https://wit.wiimm.de/opt/ticket-id for more details.
     --tmd-id id     This patching option changes the ID of tmd.bin to the
                     given parameter. 1 to 4 characters are expected. Only
                     defined characters not equal '.' are modified. The plus
                     sign '+' is a wildcard for multiple '.' to fill the
                     complete entered ID to 4 characters. Option --tmd-id
                     overrides the definition of option --id.
                     See https://wit.wiimm.de/opt/tmd-id for more details.
     --tt-id id      This is a short cut for '--ticket id --tmd id'. If TICKET
                     and TMD differ, the game will freeze after loading. So it
                     makes only sense to change TICKET and TMD IDs together.
     --wbfs-id id    This patching option changes the ID of the WBFS header to
                     the given parameter if adding a file to a WBFS or if
                     creating a WBFS file. 1 to 6 characters are expected. The
                     already patched disc ID of the source is used as base and
                     only defined characters not equal '.' are modified. The
                     plus sign '+' is a wildcard for multiple '.' to fill the
                     complete entered ID to 6 characters. Option --wbfs-id
                     overrides the definition of option --id.
                     See https://wit.wiimm.de/opt/wbfs-id for more details.
     --region region This patching option defines the region of the disc. The
                     region is one of JAPAN, USA, EUROPE, KOREA, FILE or AUTO
                     (default). The case of the keywords is ignored. Unsigned
                     numbers are also accepted.
     --common-key index 
                     This patching option defines the common key index as part
                     of the TICKET. Keywords 0, STANDARD, 1 and KOREAN are
                     accepted.
     --ios ios       This patching option defines the system version (IOS to
                     load) within TMD. The format is 'HIGH:LOW' or 'HIGH-LOW'
                     or 'LOW'. If only LOW is set than HIGH is assumed as 1
                     (standard IOS).
     --http          This patching option replaces 'https' request to 'http' in
                     the files 'main.dol' and 'rel/StaticR.rel', if the files
                     exist. It also replaces the sub-domain 'naswii' to 'nas'.
     --domain domain This patching option replaces the domain
                     'nintendowifi.net' by the new domain. The length of the
                     new domain must not be larger than the old length (16
                     characters).
                       If the new domain length is not larger than 11, then
                     'gamespy.com' of 'sake.gamespy.com' is replaced too.  This
                     is a special support for 'Super Smash Bros. Brawl'.
     --security-fix  Try to fix a security bug in the game. This is game
                     dependent.
     --wiimmfi       Patch the images for Wiimmfi, the new custom server. It is
                     a short cut for '--http --domain wiimmfi.de
                     --security-fix'.
     --rm-files ruleset 
                     This patching option defines filter rules to remove real
                     files and directories from the FST of the DATA partition.
                     Fake signing of the TMD is necessary. The processing order
                     of file options is: '--rm-files --zero-files
                     --ignore-files'.
                       See https://wit.wiimm.de/info/file-filter.html for more
                     details about file filters.
     --zero-files ruleset 
                     This patching option defines filter rules to zero (set
                     size to zero) real files of the FST of the DATA partition.
                     Fake signing of the TMD is necessary. The processing order
                     of file options is: '--rm-files --zero-files
                     --ignore-files'.
                       See https://wit.wiimm.de/info/file-filter.html for more
                     details about file filters.
     --ignore-files ruleset 
                     This option defines filter rules to ignore real files of
                     the FST of the DATA partition. Fake signing is not
                     necessary, but the partition becomes invalid, because the
                     content of some files is not copied. If such file is
                     accessed the Wii will halt immediately, because the
                     verification of the checksum calculation fails. The
                     processing order of file options is: '--rm-files
                     --zero-files --ignore-files'.
                       See https://wit.wiimm.de/info/file-filter.html for more
                     details about file filters.
     --align-part size 
                     If creating or moving partitions the beginning of each
                     partition is set to an offset that is a multiple of the
                     align size. Size must be a power of 2 and at least 32 KiB
                     (=default).
     --align-files   If creating a partition the file 'align-files.txt' is
                     read. Files listed with values >=0x8000 (Wii sector size)
                     are automatically aligned to 0x8000.
     --psel list     This option set the scrubbing mode and defines, which disc
                     partitions are handled. It expects a comma separated list
                     of keywords, numbers and names; all together called
                     parameter. All parameters are case insensitive and non
                     ambiguous abbreviations of keywords are allowed.
                       Each parameter becomes a rule and each rule is appended
                     to a rule list. Rules prefixed by a minus sign are DENY
                     rules. Rules prefixed by a plus sign or without a prefix
                     are ALLOW rules. Each partition is compared with each rule
                     until a rule matches the partition. If a match it found,
                     the partition is enabled for a ALLOW rule or disabled for
                     a DENY rule.
                       The allowed keywords are: DATA, UPDATE, CHANNEL, PTAB0
                     .. PTAB3, ID, ALL, WHOLE and RAW. The following input
                     formats are accepted too: ptype, #index, #<index,
                     #<=index, #>index, #>=index and #tab_index.part_index.
                       See https://wit.wiimm.de/opt/psel for more details.
     --raw           Abbreviation of '--psel RAW'.

  -R --remove        Remove source files/discs if operation is successful. If
                     the source is an extracted file systems (FST) it isn't
                     removed.
     --trunc         Truncate WBFS until operation finished.
  -e --newer         If source and destination have valid mtimes: Copy only if
                     source is newer.
     --sync-all      Synchronize the destination with all sources like --sync.
                     But use the include and exclude lists only to create the
                     sync list and remove all disc on the destination WBFS that
                     are not part of the sync list.

  -x --exclude id   A comma separated list with ID4 and ID6 values is expected.
                    '.' is a wildcard for exact 1 character and '+' is a
                    wildcard for any number characters. If the parameter begins
                    with a '@' the given file is read and each line is scanned
                    for one ID. Images with the given ID are excluded from
                    operation. Each use of this option expands the exclude
                    list. See --include-first for precedence issues.
  -X --exclude-path file_or_dir 
                    Scan the ID of the source and add it to the exclude list.
                    If the source is a directory then scan all images of the
                    directory. Images with the given ID are excluded from
                    operation. Each use of this option expands the exclude
                    list. See --include-first for precedence issues.
  -n --include id   A comma separated list with ID values is expected. '.' is a
                    wildcard for exact 1 character and '+' is a wildcard for
                    any number characters. If the parameter begins with a '@'
                    the given file is read and each line is scanned for one ID.
                    Only images with the given ID are included into the
                    operation. Each use of this option expands the include
                    list. See --include-first for precedence issues.
  -N --include-path file_or_dir 
                    Scan the ID of the source and add it to the include list.
                    If the source is a directory then scan all images of the
                    directory. Only images with the given ID are included into
                    the operation. Each use of this option expands the include

                    The options --include, --include-path, --exclude and
                    --exclude-path decide which discs are included into the

 The TOUCH command changes the time stamps in rhe WBFS inodes of all discs
 identified by ID6 from all given WBFS partitions. The options --all, --auto
 and --part decides which partitions will be modified (see section "Options
 in detail: partitions" for details).

 Each parameter is scanned for an ID6. Possible formats are:
    '*' | '+'
    ID6
    ID6=name
    name [ID6]
    ID6 anything
 A single '*' (must be escaped by shells) or '+' means 'all'. A 'name' part
 will be ignored. Please read section "Processing ID6 parameters" for details.

 The option --ignore suppresses error messages about not found disc images.

 If the --quiet option is set only error messages will be printed.
 If the --verbose option is set run time claculations will be made too.

 If the --test option is set the programm does nothing, neither copying nor
 removing. Instead it will print some 'WOULD ...' messages.
 If the --test option is set two or more times then only a normalized ID6
 list is printed. For each ID6 one line is printed. If a destination
 filename is known 'ID=name' is printed, else 'ID6' alone.

 If the option --no-free is set then the disc is only makred as removed. The
 allocated blocks are not freed. Aufter using --no-free you should use the
 command CHECK with --rapair=fbt to repair the free blocks table.

 The options --itime, --mtime, --ctime, --atime decides which time stamp is
 modified. All 4 options can be combined. If none of these options is set
 then all 4 time stamps are modified.

 The time stamps are set to the current time (beginning of command touch).
 With the option --set-time=time an other date can be set. The format of
 'time' is one of the following (in terms of function strptime()):

    "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"
    "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"
    "%Y-%m-%d %H%M%S"
    "%Y-%m-%d %H%M"
    "%Y-%m-%d %H"
    "%Y-%m-%d"
    "%Y%m%d %H%M%S"
    "%Y%m%d %H%M"
    "%Y%m%d %H"
    "%Y%m%d"
    "%s"

 Before modifying the WBFS a check (see CHECK) is done. If there are any
 problematic errors detected the WBFS is ignored. If the option --force is set,
 the test is done but the result is ignored. The option --no-check disables
 this automatic check.

 The SPACE command makes a quick search for WBFS partitions: it scans only the
 WBFS-Header. The three options --all, --auto and --part decides where partitions
 will be searched (see section "Options in detail: partitions" for details).

 If at least one parameter ('wbfs_partition') is given ther option --all well be
 enabled and all names are insterted into the partition list like --auto.
 This enables an easy lookup like 'wwt find *.wbfs'.

 The SPACE/DF command prints:
    size  : file size in MiB.
    used  : space used by discs in MiB.
    used% : space used by discs in percent.
    free  : free space for discs in MiB.
    discs : number of wii discs / max number of discs
    file  : the given path name of the file.

 With option --long the real path instead aa the given filename is printed.
 The option --no-header suppress the output of header and footer.

 The command TRUNCATE truncates WBFS to a minmal size. This is done by
 calculating the last used block within th WBFS. The WBFS is still valid
 and all modification may be done.

 Before modifying the WBFS a check (see CHECK) is done. If there are any
 problematic errors detected the WBFS is ignored. If the option --force is set,
 the test is done but the result is ignored. The option --no-check disables

Syntax: wwt UPDATE [[--source|--recurse] source]...

Options:

  -T --titles file   Read file for disc titles. -T/ disables automatic search
                     for title files.
     --utf-8         Enables UTF-8 support for filenames (default).
     --no-utf-8      Disables UTF-8 support for filenames.
     --lang lang     Define the language for titles.

  -a --auto          Search for WBFS partitions using '/proc/partitions' or
                     searching hard disks in '/dev/'.
  -A --all           Use all WBFS partitions found.
  -p --part part     Define a primary WBFS file or partition. Multiple usage
                     possible.
     --no-check      Disable automatic check of WBFS before modifications.

     --wbfs-alloc mode 
                     Select one WBFS block allocation modus:
                       FIRST: Use always the first free WBFS block. NO-FRAG:
                     Find large blocks to minimize fragmentation. AUTO
                     (=default): Use modus NO-FRAG for partitions >=20GiB and
                     modus FIRST for partitions <20GiB and for files.
     --source path   Use the entered file or directory as source.
                       If parameter PATH contains at least one wildcard (e.g.
                     '*.wbfs'), then PATH is used as search pattern and all
                     found files are added. In order to use this variant, the
                     calling shell must not interpret the wildcards. Therefore,
                     the parameter must usually be enclosed in single or double
                     quotes.
                       Directories are expanded to all containing files but
                     hidden files (file names begins with a point) are ignored.
                     If a command needs only images then non image files of the
                     directory are ignored without notification. The option
                     --no-expand suppress the directory expansion.
     --no-expand     Do not expand directories to the containing files or
                     images. This option does not change the behavior of
                     --recurse.
  -r --recurse path  If path is not a directory, then it is used as a simple
                     source file like --source.
                       If parameter PATH contains at least one wildcard (e.g.
                     '*.wbfs'), then PATH is used as search pattern and all
                     found files are added. In order to use this variant, the
                     calling shell must not interpret the wildcards. Therefore,
                     the parameter must usually be enclosed in single or double
                     quotes.
                       Directories are scanned for source files recursively.
                     The option --rdepth limits the search depth. Hidden files
                     and hidden sub directories (file names begins with a
                     point) and files with non supported file types (non ISO
                     files for most commands) are ignored without notification.
     --rdepth depth  Set the maximum recurse depth for option --recurse. The
                     default search depth is 10.
  -x --exclude id    A comma separated list with ID4 and ID6 values is
                     expected. '.' is a wildcard for exact 1 character and '+'
                     is a wildcard for any number characters. If the parameter
                     begins with a '@' the given file is read and each line is
                     scanned for one ID. Images with the given ID are excluded
                     from operation. Each use of this option expands the
                     exclude list. See --include-first for precedence issues.
  -X --exclude-path file_or_dir 
                     Scan the ID of the source and add it to the exclude list.
                     If the source is a directory then scan all images of the
                     directory. Images with the given ID are excluded from
                     operation. Each use of this option expands the exclude
                     list. See --include-first for precedence issues.
  -n --include id    A comma separated list with ID values is expected. '.' is
                     a wildcard for exact 1 character and '+' is a wildcard for
                     any number characters. If the parameter begins with a '@'
                     the given file is read and each line is scanned for one
                     ID. Only images with the given ID are included into the
                     operation. Each use of this option expands the include
                     list. See --include-first for precedence issues.
  -N --include-path file_or_dir 
                     Scan the ID of the source and add it to the include list.
                     If the source is a directory then scan all images of the
                     directory. Only images with the given ID are included into
                     the operation. Each use of this option expands the include
                     list. See --include-first for precedence issues.
     --include-first The options --include, --include-path, --exclude and
                     --exclude-path decide which discs are included into the
                     operation. If neither include nor exclude options are
                     used, than all disc are included into the operation. If
                     only include options are used, than only the specified
                     discs are operated. If only exclude options are used, than
                     all all discs but not the excluded are operated.
                       If include and exclude options are used together and
                     --include-first is not set, than all discs are operated
                     that are specified by any include option and not by any
                     exclude option. If --include-first is set, than all discs
                     are ignored that are specified by any exclude option and
                     not by any include option.
  -1 --one-job       Execute only the first job and exit. This is a shortcut
                     for '--job-limit 1'.
     --job-limit num Execute only the first 'num' jobs and exit. If done
                     without errors the exit status is OK (zero).
  -i --ignore        Ignore non existing files/discs without warning. If set
                     twice then all non Wii and GameCube ISO images are ignored
                     too.
     --ignore-fst    Disable composing and ignore FST directories as input.
                     This legacy option is a shortcut for --allow-fst=off.
     --ignore-setup  While composing ignore the file 'setup.txt', which defines
                     some partition parameters.
     --links         Detect soft and hard linked source files while composing
                     or extracting discs and try to create hard links instead
                     of independent copies on the destination file system.

  -P --progress      Print progress counter. If --verbose is set at least
                     twice, printing is enabled too. If progress is enabled,
                     the default of --dsync is changed.
     --scan-progress Print a message for each found image while scanning the

                     makes only sense to change TICKET and TMD IDs together.
     --wbfs-id id    This patching option changes the ID of the WBFS header to
                     the given parameter if adding a file to a WBFS or if
                     creating a WBFS file. 1 to 6 characters are expected. The
                     already patched disc ID of the source is used as base and
                     only defined characters not equal '.' are modified. The
                     plus sign '+' is a wildcard for multiple '.' to fill the
                     complete entered ID to 6 characters. Option --wbfs-id
                     overrides the definition of option --id.
                     See https://wit.wiimm.de/opt/wbfs-id for more details.
     --region region This patching option defines the region of the disc. The
                     region is one of JAPAN, USA, EUROPE, KOREA, FILE or AUTO
                     (default). The case of the keywords is ignored. Unsigned
                     numbers are also accepted.
     --common-key index 
                     This patching option defines the common key index as part
                     of the TICKET. Keywords 0, STANDARD, 1 and KOREAN are
                     accepted.
     --ios ios       This patching option defines the system version (IOS to
                     load) within TMD. The format is 'HIGH:LOW' or 'HIGH-LOW'
                     or 'LOW'. If only LOW is set than HIGH is assumed as 1
                     (standard IOS).
     --http          This patching option replaces 'https' request to 'http' in
                     the files 'main.dol' and 'rel/StaticR.rel', if the files
                     exist. It also replaces the sub-domain 'naswii' to 'nas'.
     --domain domain This patching option replaces the domain
                     'nintendowifi.net' by the new domain. The length of the
                     new domain must not be larger than the old length (16
                     characters).
                       If the new domain length is not larger than 11, then
                     'gamespy.com' of 'sake.gamespy.com' is replaced too.  This
                     is a special support for 'Super Smash Bros. Brawl'.
     --security-fix  Try to fix a security bug in the game. This is game
                     dependent.
     --wiimmfi       Patch the images for Wiimmfi, the new custom server. It is
                     a short cut for '--http --domain wiimmfi.de
                     --security-fix'.
     --rm-files ruleset 
                     This patching option defines filter rules to remove real
                     files and directories from the FST of the DATA partition.
                     Fake signing of the TMD is necessary. The processing order
                     of file options is: '--rm-files --zero-files
                     --ignore-files'.
                       See https://wit.wiimm.de/info/file-filter.html for more
                     details about file filters.
     --zero-files ruleset 
                     This patching option defines filter rules to zero (set
                     size to zero) real files of the FST of the DATA partition.
                     Fake signing of the TMD is necessary. The processing order
                     of file options is: '--rm-files --zero-files
                     --ignore-files'.
                       See https://wit.wiimm.de/info/file-filter.html for more
                     details about file filters.
     --ignore-files ruleset 
                     This option defines filter rules to ignore real files of
                     the FST of the DATA partition. Fake signing is not
                     necessary, but the partition becomes invalid, because the
                     content of some files is not copied. If such file is
                     accessed the Wii will halt immediately, because the
                     verification of the checksum calculation fails. The
                     processing order of file options is: '--rm-files
                     --zero-files --ignore-files'.
                       See https://wit.wiimm.de/info/file-filter.html for more
                     details about file filters.
     --align-part size 
                     If creating or moving partitions the beginning of each
                     partition is set to an offset that is a multiple of the
                     align size. Size must be a power of 2 and at least 32 KiB
                     (=default).
     --align-files   If creating a partition the file 'align-files.txt' is
                     read. Files listed with values >=0x8000 (Wii sector size)
                     are automatically aligned to 0x8000.
     --psel list     This option set the scrubbing mode and defines, which disc
                     partitions are handled. It expects a comma separated list
                     of keywords, numbers and names; all together called
                     parameter. All parameters are case insensitive and non
                     ambiguous abbreviations of keywords are allowed.
                       Each parameter becomes a rule and each rule is appended
                     to a rule list. Rules prefixed by a minus sign are DENY
                     rules. Rules prefixed by a plus sign or without a prefix
                     are ALLOW rules. Each partition is compared with each rule
                     until a rule matches the partition. If a match it found,
                     the partition is enabled for a ALLOW rule or disabled for
                     a DENY rule.
                       The allowed keywords are: DATA, UPDATE, CHANNEL, PTAB0
                     .. PTAB3, ID, ALL, WHOLE and RAW. The following input
                     formats are accepted too: ptype, #index, #<index,
                     #<=index, #>index, #>=index and #tab_index.part_index.
                       See https://wit.wiimm.de/opt/psel for more details.
     --raw           Abbreviation of '--psel RAW'.

  -R --remove        Remove source files/discs if operation is successful. If
                     the source is an extracted file systems (FST) it isn't
                     removed.
     --trunc         Truncate WBFS until operation finished.
  -e --newer         If source and destination have valid mtimes: Copy only if
                     source is newer.
     --sync-all      Synchronize the destination with all sources like --sync.
                     But use the include and exclude lists only to create the
                     sync list and remove all disc on the destination WBFS that
                     are not part of the sync list.
  -y --sync          Synchronize the destination with all sources: Remove and
                     copy discs until the destination WBFS contains exactly the
                     same discs as all sources together. Remove and add only
                     discs in respect to the include and exclude lists.

wwt VERIFY|V : Verify all discs of WBFS (calculate and compare SHA1 checksums)
               to find bad dumps.

Syntax: wwt VERIFY [id6]...

Options:

  -T --titles file  Read file for disc titles. -T/ disables automatic search
                    for title files.
     --utf-8        Enables UTF-8 support for filenames (default).
     --no-utf-8     Disables UTF-8 support for filenames.
     --lang lang    Define the language for titles.

  -a --auto         Search for WBFS partitions using '/proc/partitions' or
                    searching hard disks in '/dev/'.
  -A --all          Use all WBFS partitions found.
  -p --part part    Define a primary WBFS file or partition. Multiple usage
                    possible.
     --no-check     Disable automatic check of WBFS before modifications.

  -x --exclude id   A comma separated list with ID4 and ID6 values is expected.
                    '.' is a wildcard for exact 1 character and '+' is a
                    wildcard for any number characters. If the parameter begins
                    with a '@' the given file is read and each line is scanned
                    for one ID. Images with the given ID are excluded from
                    operation. Each use of this option expands the exclude
                    list. See --include-first for precedence issues.
  -X --exclude-path file_or_dir 
                    Scan the ID of the source and add it to the exclude list.
                    If the source is a directory then scan all images of the
                    directory. Images with the given ID are excluded from
                    operation. Each use of this option expands the exclude
                    list. See --include-first for precedence issues.
  -n --include id   A comma separated list with ID values is expected. '.' is a
                    wildcard for exact 1 character and '+' is a wildcard for
                    any number characters. If the parameter begins with a '@'
                    the given file is read and each line is scanned for one ID.
                    Only images with the given ID are included into the
                    operation. Each use of this option expands the include
                    list. See --include-first for precedence issues.
  -N --include-path file_or_dir 
                    Scan the ID of the source and add it to the include list.
                    If the source is a directory then scan all images of the
                    directory. Only images with the given ID are included into
                    the operation. Each use of this option expands the include
                    list. See --include-first for precedence issues.
     --include-first 
                    The options --include, --include-path, --exclude and
                    --exclude-path decide which discs are included into the
                    operation. If neither include nor exclude options are used,
                    than all disc are included into the operation. If only
                    include options are used, than only the specified discs are
                    operated. If only exclude options are used, than all all
                    discs but not the excluded are operated.
                      If include and exclude options are used together and
                    --include-first is not set, than all discs are operated
                    that are specified by any include option and not by any
                    exclude option. If --include-first is set, than all discs
                    are ignored that are specified by any exclude option and
                    not by any include option.
  -1 --one-job      Execute only the first job and exit. This is a shortcut for
                    '--job-limit 1'.
     --job-limit num 
                    Execute only the first 'num' jobs and exit. If done without
                    errors the exit status is OK (zero).

  -q --quiet        Be quiet and print only error messages.
  -v --verbose      Show a runtime summary for each job. If set twice enable
                    progress information. If set three times the progress
                    information is more detailed.
  -P --progress     Print progress counter. If --verbose is set at least twice,
                    printing is enabled too. If progress is enabled, the
                    default of --dsync is changed.
     --scan-progress 
                    Print a message for each found image while scanning the
                    file system.
  -L --logging      This debug option enables the logging of internal memory
                    maps. If set twice second level memory maps are printed
                    too.
     --limit num    Maximal printed errors of each partition. A zero means
                    unlimited. The default is 10.

  -t --test         Run in test mode, modify nothing.
                    >>> USE THIS OPTION IF UNSURE! <<<

-A --all          Use all WBFS partitions found.
-a --auto         Search for WBFS partitions using /proc/partitions.
-p --part  part   File of primary WBFS partition. Multiple usage allowed.
-p --part  @file  Special case: read partition list from 'file' ('-'=stdin).

These 3 options defines how to search for WBFS partitions.
The program generates an internal partition list. This partition list is
filled by --part and --auto. --part may be set multiple times.

Partitions set with the --part option must be existent, readable and valid WBFS
partitions (exceptions explained in the command documentation). Partitions set
with --auto are only used, if the partition is readable and the WBFS magic is
found. If more than one partition is defined by --part then --all is set.

If using the special case '--part @file' each line of the given file is one
partition. Each line may terminate with LF or CR+LF. Handling of '@' is
*not* recurse. The special filename '-' means: read from standard input (stdin).
This nice feature enables shell commands like: "wwt df -p@<(ls *.wbfs)".

The program terminates with an error if not exactly one valid WBFS partition is
found. When using --all at least one partition must be found.

If neither the option --part nor --auto is set then the environment variable
'WWT_WBFS' is searched. It contains a semicolon separated list of filenames.
If one ore more of this files is a valid WBFS partition it is silently added
to the partition list and the option --all is set.

If neither the option --part nor --auto is set, but option --all, than
option --auto is set automatically.

Commands like "wwt ADD" or "wit COPY" uses ISO files as input. They accept
plain ISO files and ISO files in WDF, CISO and WBFS containers and FST
directories. In detail:

 /path/to/PLAIN_ISO:
    A PLAIN ISO file is a 1:1 copy of a Wii disc, may be scrubbed. It is not
    compressed and not part of any container. The standard extension is ".iso".

 /path/to/WDF_ISO:
    This is an ISO packed in a WDF container. WDF container may be used for
    any files and not only for ISO images. The standard extension is ".wdf".

 /path/to/CISO:
    This is an ISO packed in a CISO container. CISO container may be used for
    any files and not only for ISO images. The standard extensions are
    ".ciso" (default) and ".wbi".

 /path/to/WBFS_FILE
    An WBFS file/device is also accepted like a list of ISO files. The standard
    extension for WBFS files is ".wbfs".

 /path/to/WBFS_FILE/SELECTOR
    This is a special construct. The ISO image of the WBFS_FILE selected
    by SELECTOR is used as source. The selector may be one of:

     - 'ABCDEF' : ID6 of a disc (exact 6 characters)

     - index    : The zero based index of the disc. The range goes from zero
                  up to the number of discs in the WBFS minus 1.
                  (decimal number, but not 6 digits)

     - '#' slot : The decimal slot number within the WBFS. The range goes from
                  zero up to the maximal number of possible discs in the WBFS
                  minus 1.

    Examples:
      .../a.wbfs/rmcp01 : use "Mario Kart" from 'a.wbfs' as source.
      .../a.wbfs/5      : use the image with index #5 from 'a.wbfs' as source.
      .../a.wbfs/#5     : use the image at slot #5 from 'a.wbfs' as source.

 /path/do/FST_directory
    If the path is a directory and the directory contains a valid FST (File
    SysTem) structure then the directory structure is used to build an internal
    virtual ISO image. Most commands can use this virtual ISO image like a
    real image.


When writing ISO files the option --wdf, --iso, --ciso, --wbfs and --fst
control the output format. If writing a WBFS file this WBFS is truncated and
contains exactly one ISO image. The default file name of this WBFS is
'<ID6>.wbfs'. If none of --wdf, --iso, --ciso, --wbfs or --fst is set, the
destination filename will be analyzed. If the extension (ignoring case) is
".wdf", ".iso", ".ciso", ".wbi" (an alternative for ".ciso") or ".wbfs",
the specific output format is used. The default is WDF if all other fails.



*******************************************************************************
*******                    Processing ID6 parameters                    *******
*******************************************************************************

Discs in a WBFS partition are addressed by its ID6. Therfor commands like
EXTRACT and REMOVE needs as parameters an ID6 tag. And EXTRACT needs also
the name of the destination file. This section describes the processing
of ID6 parameters.

First all control characters (ASCII <32) will be replaced by a space. Spaces
at the beginning and a the end are removed. Multiples spaces will be replaced
by a single space.

In the second step each parameter will be processed by the following rules.
If one rule matches the processing terminates. ID6 are words that contains
exactly 6 characters in the range a-z, A-Z and 0-9. All other characters are
word separators. ID6 is converted into upper case.

The rules as overview:
    '*' | '+'
    ID4
    ID6
    ID6 = name
    name [ID6]
    ID6 anything


1.) '*' | '+'

    Both characters has the same meaning: Use all ID6 will be found on the
    given WFS partitions. The parameter will be replaced by the complete ID6
    list. A destination filename is not defined.

	Only the first occurrence will be processed. All other are ignord.

    Note: '*' is the natural 'all' placeholder but must be escaped in most
          shells. Therefor the additional '+' is possible.

2.) ID4

    If the parameter contains exactly one ID4 and nothing else the ID4 is
    used. Only for some commands/options a pure ID4 is allowd.

3.) ID6

    If the parameter contains exactly one ID6 and nothing else the ID6 is
    used. A destination filename is not defined.

4.) ID6 = name

    Use this format to set an ID6 and an destination filename. Blanks before
    and behind '=' are ignored. The name is used as the destination filename.

5.) name [ID6]

    The line is searched for an ID6 which is directly included in square
    bracktes. If more than 1 '[ID6]' is found the last one will be used.
    The whole parameter is used as the destination filename.

6.) ID6 anything

    This is the table support. The ID6 is taken and the remaining is ignored.
    A destination filename is not defined.

If the option --unique is supported and set then repeated parameters with the
same ID6 are eliminated. The last non empty destination filename is used.

If a destination filename is needed but none is set than the a name from the
title database or an internal name of the game will be used. Before creating
an ISO image the destination filename is post processed to eliminate unusal
characters. Only single spaces, A-Z, a-z, 0-9 and _+-='"$%&,.!()[]{}<> are
allowed.


*******************************************************************************
*******             Processing include and exclude options              *******
*******************************************************************************

The user may define ID inclusion and exclusion lists. Each element represents
an ID4 or an ID6. Discs with an ID in the exclusion list are ignored (not
added, extracted, removed or listed). If --include or --include-path is used,
only discs in the include list are processed.

The include list is controlled by the to options --include and --include-path
and the exclude list by the options --exclude and --exclude-path. All four
options can be used multiple times. The exclude list ha a higher priority
as the include list.

 -n --include id     Include oly discs with given ID4 or ID6 from operation.
 -n --include @file  Read include list from file.

 -N --include-path file_or_dir
                     ISO file or base of directory tree -> scan their ID6

 -x --exclude id     Exclude discs with given ID4 or ID6 from operation.
 -x --exclude @file  Read exclude list from file.

 -X --exclude-path file_or_dir
                     ISO file or base of directory tree -> scan their ID6

The parameters of --include and --exclude are scanned for ID6. Th section
"Processing ID6 parameters" describes this scanning in detail.

The parameter of --include-path and --exclude-path is a filename or a
directory name. The given file or each file of the directory tree (recurse,
max depth=15) are scanned. Subdirectories beginning with a dot ('.') are
ignored. If a file exists and is an ISO file the ID6 is extracted and inserted
into the include or exclude data base.

Example:

 You want to make a backup from all new discs of 2 USB drives. The new
 backups should be stored info the sub directory 'new-backup'. The existing
 backups are stored in 'old-backup'. The file names of the old backups does
 not matter:

 # wwt extract -aA --dest new-backup --exclude-path old-backup

The command 'EXCLUDE' use the options --exclude and --exclude-path to builtd
the exclude data base and prints the result to stdout.


*******************************************************************************
*******                      Processing title db                        *******
*******************************************************************************

Title files without path specification are search in up to 4 directories:
  1.) In the program path.
  2.) If the program end with "/bin/" in "<PROGRAM_PATH>/../share/wit/".
  3.) In the directory "/usr/local/share/wit/"
  4.) In the current working directory "./"
If you want to search only in the current working directory prefix the file
name with './'. If setting option --verbose at least 4 times (e.g. -vvvv)
the search paths will be logged.

The titles are loaded first time they needed. At first the following three
files are searched in the search path:
  - titles.txt (comes with the distribution)
  - titles-<LANG>.txt (see below)
  - titles.local.txt (for local specificatons)
After that all files specified by the --titles options are scanned.

The idea: The file "titles.txt" is the main title database. It is a copy from
http://wiitdb.com/titles.txt. The file "titles-<LANG>.txt" may contain
language specific definitions. "<LANG>" are the first lower case letters of
the environment variable "LC_CTYPE". The file "titles.local.txt" may contain
local definitions for the user.

The option -T / --titles in detail:

  --titles=0 .. --titles=9
     Set the title mode to a value between 0 and 9.
      0: disable title lookup.
      1: Use titles instead of real disc names. (deault)
      2..9: reserved.

  --titles=/
     Remove all previous --title definitions an do not load the default
     title files.

  --titles=@file
     Use the given file as a list of filenames. Each non empty line is
     interpreted as a filename.

  --titles=@-
     Read standard input (stdin). Each non empty line is interpreted as
     a filename.

  --titles=-
     Read standard input (stdin) and scan it for titles.

  --titles=file
     This is a filename without '/': Read the given file and scan it for
     titles. The file is searched in the search path described above.

  --titles=path/file
     Read the given file and scan it for titles.

If setting option --verbose at least 3 times (e.g. -vvv) all successfull
loaded titles files will be logged. If setting --verbose at least 4 times
the search paths and all searched title files will be logged.

Each line of each title file is scanned for title definitions:
    ID4 = name
    ID6 = name

The title database is build with both ID-types. A later file overides the
settings of all previous files: If an ID4 is found, all ID4 and ID6
definitions of all previous files are removed. If an ID6 is found, only
the previous ID6 definition is removed.

For each database lookup first an ID6 entry is searched. Only if this fails
an ID4 entry is searched.

The titles are expected in UTF-8 coding. Non UTF-8 characters are converted
into UTF-8. If the options --no-utf-8 is set than the title database is
converted into ANSI and all output will also be printed in ANSI.

The command 'TITLES' builts the title data base and prints the result to
stdout.


*******************************************************************************
*******                    Processing split options                     *******
*******************************************************************************

Output files may be splittet into multiple files. The options --split and
--split-size controls the output splitting:

  -z --split            Enable output file splitting, default size = 4 gb.
                        4 gb means 4.000.000.000 bytes (4 billion bytes).
                        The default size for a WBFS is different. It is
                        4GiB-32KiB = 0xffff8000 = 4.294.934.528 bytes.

  -Z --split-size size  Enable output file splitting and set split size.
                        See section "Processing size options" for detailed
                        infos about the 'size' argument.

A new file is created every time when the previous one reached the split size.
Input split files are automatically detected. Only the last file of the input
split file may grow if opened in modify mode.

The split size always rounded down to a multiply of 512 (0x200), the hd sector
size. For a WBFS it is rounde down to a multiply of 32 KiB (32768, 0x8000),
the WII ISO sector size.

There are two naming schemas for the splitted files:

WBFS files are named like (defined by oggzee):
    - name.wbfs
    - name.wbf1
    - name.wbf2
      ...
    - name.wbf9
    - name.wbf10
      ...

All other files are named like:
    - name.ext
    - name.ext.1
    - name.ext.2
      ...
    - name.ext.9
    - name.ext.10
      ...

The WIT tools supports splitted WDF files *not* following the rules for
splitted WDF files. All files are splitted hard by breaking the files into
peaces. This is done by the file layer so that other layer including the WDF
layer don't see the split.

These are the rules for automatic detection of split files. The automatic
detection works only for plain files but not for other files types like
block devices or pipes:

 WBFS file:
    The last character of the filename is replaced by '1'. If a file with
    this new filename is available, the split file support is enabled.

 WDF file:
    The WDF header is read. If the current WDF files is to short and a file
    with same filename plus '.1' exists, the split file support is enabled.

 ISO file:
    If the file is smaller than 4 GiB and a file with same filename plus '.1'
    exists then then split file support is enabled.


*******************************************************************************
*******                    Processing size options                      *******
*******************************************************************************

The different programs using different options to setup size values. These
options are --size, --split-size, --hss and --wss. The processing of the
arguments are identical for all size options.

The argument syntax is: term [ sign term ]... [sign]
with term := float [factor]

 'float' is any C like floating point number like '12', '1.2' or '1e5'.
 'sign' is either the character '+' or the character '-'.

 'factor' is one of the following characters:

    'c' : char, numeric factor = 1
    'b' : byte, numeric factor = 1

    'k' : kilo, numeric factor = 1 kB = 1000
    'm' : mega, numeric factor = 1 MB = 1000*1000
    'g' : giga, numeric factor = 1 GB = 1000*1000*1000
    't' : tera, numeric factor = 1 TB = 1000*1000*1000*1000
    'p' : peta, numeric factor = 1 PB = 1000*1000*1000*1000*1000
    'e' : exa,  numeric factor = 1 EB = 1000*1000*1000*1000*1000*1000

    'K' : kilo, numeric factor = 1 KiB = 1024
    'M' : mega, numeric factor = 1 MiB = 1024*1024
    'G' : giga, numeric factor = 1 GiB = 1024*1024*1024
    'T' : tera, numeric factor = 1 TiB = 1024*1024*1024*1024
    'P' : peta, numeric factor = 1 PiB = 1024*1024*1024*1024*1024
    'E' : exa,  numeric factor = 1 EiB = 1024*1024*1024*1024*1024*1024

    'u' | 'U' : size of a GameCube disc        = 1 459 978 240
    'w' | 'W' : size of a singe layer Wii disc = 4 699 979 776

  Without 'factor' a default factor is used. This default factor is different
  for the first term and for the other terms. The default factors depends on
  the used option.

The terms are added together. If there is at the very end of the term 1 sign
it wil be interpreted as '-1' or '+1' (using the default factor for other terms).

Option --size
    Default factor for first term:     1G
    Default factors for other terms:   1
    Minimal value:                    10m

Option --split-size
    Default factor for first term:     1G
    Default factors for other terms: 512
    Value must be multiples of:      512
    Minimal value:                   100m

Option --hss
    Default factor for all terms:      1
    Value must be power of:            2
    Minimal value:                   512

Option --wss
    Default factor for all terms:      1
    Value must be power of:            2
    Minimal value:                  1024

Examples:
    --split-size 2g     -> split at 2.000.000.000 bytes.
    --split-size 1g     -> split at 1.000.000.000 bytes.
    --split-size 1G     -> split at 1.073.741.824 bytes = 1 GiB.
    --split-size 0.5g   -> split at   500.000.000 bytes.
    --split-size 2G-1K  -> split at 2 GiB - 1 KiB.
    --split-size 2G-1   -> split at 2 GiB - 512
    --split-size 2-1    -> split at 2 GiB - 512
    --split-size 2-     -> split at 2 GiB - 512
    -Z2-                -> split at 2 GiB - 512

  Syntax: --sort sort_mode | -S sort_mode

'sort_mode' is a comma separated list of the following keywords:

    -  | NONE    : Do not sort

         ID      : Sort by id
    T  | TITLE   : Sort by title taken from title db
    N  | NAME    : Sort by name of disc

    R  | REGION  : Sort by region
         WBFS    : Sort by wbfs file name
         NPART   : Sort by number of partitions

    IT | ITIME   : Sort by itime (insertion time)
    MT | MTIME   : Sort by mtime (last modification time)
    CT | CTIME   : Sort by ctime (last status change time)
    AT | ATIME   : Sort by atime (last access time)
    TI | TIME    : Sort by itime|mtime|atime|atime, decided by the time options.
    D  | DATE    : Alternative keyword for 'TIME'

      DEFAULT    : Use the default sort method for that output

      ASCENDING  : Sort in ascending order.
      DESCENDING : Sort in descending order (reverse).
      REVERSE    : Alternative keyword for 'DESCEND'.

The latest keyword supersedes the previous one of the same group.
'NONE' resets all. Abbreviations are allowed as long as they are unique.
